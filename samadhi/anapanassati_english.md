*Ānāpānassati, bhikkhave, bhāvitā bahulīkatā mahapphalā hoti mahānisaṁsā. Ānāpānassati, bhikkhave, bhāvitā bahulīkatā cattāro satipaṭṭhāne paripūreti. Cattāro satipaṭṭhānā bhāvitā bahulīkatā satta bojjhaṅge paripūrenti. Satta bojjhaṅgā bhāvitā bahulīkatā vijjāvimuttiṁ paripūrenti.*

Monks, Ānāpānassati, when repeatedly practised, leads to great results and is of great benefit. Ānāpānassati, when repeatedly practised, fulfils the four foundations of mindfulness. The four foundations of mindfulness, when repeatedly practised, fulfil the seven factors of Awakening. The seven factors of Awakening, when repeatedly practised, fulfil *Vijja* and freedom. 

*Kathaṁ bhāvitā ca, bhikkhave, ānāpānassati kathaṁ bahulīkatā mahapphalā hoti mahānisaṁsā?*

How is Ānāpānassati, when repeatedly practised, leads to great results and is of great benefit?

*Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu araññagato vā rukkhamūlagato vā suññāgāragato vā nisīdati pallaṅkaṁ ābhujitvā ujuṁ kāyaṁ paṇidhāya parimukhaṁ satiṁ upaṭṭhapetvā.*

That is when a monk goes to the forest or the root of a tree or to a secluded hut, sits with his legs folded in a comfortable posture with his body erect and focuses his attention in front (of the mind).

*So satova assasati satova passasati.*

He is mindfully aware of the coming in and the going out (of the mind).

> The mind that is coming in: The mind is turning inwards, or becoming watchful of its state. Its self-awareness is increasing. 
> The mind that is going out: The mind is moving into the thought world. It is grasping the object in front of it or reacting to the stimuli. Its self-awareness is decreasing. 

*1. Dīghaṁ vā assasanto ‘dīghaṁ assasāmī’ti pajānāti, dīghaṁ vā passasanto ‘dīghaṁ passasāmī’ti pajānāti;*

When the mind is coming in/turning inwards for a long time, he knows 'The mind is inside for a long time'. When the mind is going out for a long time, he knows 'The mind is outside for a long time'.

*2. rassaṁ vā assasanto ‘rassaṁ assasāmī’ti pajānāti, rassaṁ vā passasanto ‘rassaṁ passasāmī’ti pajānāti;*

When the mind is coming in/turning inwards for a short time, he knows 'The mind is inside for a short time'. When the mind is going out for a short time, he knows 'The mind is outside for a short time'.

> Every step has two parts, the first part is about recognising the inward journey of the mind, and once sustained, will lead the monk/trainee to the next step. The second part is about recognising the outward journey of the mind, or a regression, and hence will lead to one of the previous steps. 

*3. ‘sabbakāyapaṭisaṁvedī assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘sabbakāyapaṭisaṁvedī passasissāmī’ti sikkhati;*

He practices thus: 'I will be aware of coming to a state of mind where the mind experiences the whole body.'  'I will be aware of going out of a state of mind where the mind experiences the whole body', thus he practices. 

> This is a state of mind where one is aware of everything as it happens within the whole body. It enables the mind to stay focused inward for more extended periods. 

*4. 'passambhayaṁ kāyasaṅkhāraṁ assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, 'passambhayaṁ kāyasaṅkhāraṁ passasissāmī’ti sikkhati.*

He practices thus: "I will be aware of the mind coming to a state where the conditioned automatic reactions (*kāyasaṅkhāra*) of the body are calmed, I will be aware of the mind going out of a state where the conditioned automatic reactions of the body are calmed".

> Assume an itching sensation has begun, and in everyday life, the mind does not become aware of it. A conditioned automatic reaction (*kāyasaṅkhāra*) kicks in, which is to scratch it. Now, from step 3, the mind becomes aware of everything happening in the body, so it is aware of an itching sensation. If the mind does not react to it, the automatic response to scratch it subsides. That is *passambhayaṁ kāyasaṅkhāraṁ*, the calming of the conditioned automatic reactions of the body.

*5. 'Pītipaṭisaṁvedī assasissāmī'ti sikkhati, 'pītipaṭisaṁvedī passasissāmī'ti sikkhati; *

He practices thus: 'I will be aware of coming to a state of mind where the mind experiences delight (*piti*); I will be aware of going out of a state of mind where the mind experiences delight (*piti*)'

> This state is a natural progression of the mind, which has turned inwards. The usual distractions are receding, and the mind can see itself more clearly. This signals joy & delight. A mind in this state can view pleasant and painful experiences on the body and mind with more objectivity and not become emotionally attached. 

*6. ‘sukhapaṭisaṁvedī assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘sukhapaṭisaṁvedī passasissāmī’ti sikkhati;*

He practices thus: 'I will be aware of coming to a state of mind where the mind experiences calm/peace; I will be aware of going out of a state of mind where the mind experiences calm/peace'

> This is a more subtle state than the *piti*, one in which there is a beginning of stillness. In this state, the meditator will be able to look at the most painful experiences with relative ease. 

*7. ‘cittasaṅkhārapaṭisaṁvedī assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘cittasaṅkhārapaṭisaṁvedī passasissāmī’ti sikkhati;*

He practices thus: 'I will be aware of coming to a state of mind where the mind experiences (*cittasaṅkhāra*) conditioned automatic reactions of the mind; I will be aware of going out of a state of mind where the mind experiences (*cittasaṅkhāra*) conditioned automatic reactions of the mind; '

> *cittasaṅkhāra* or conditioned automatic reactions of the mind are the distortions that our conditioning adds to whatever is arising on its own from the mind or through the sense doors. When something arises on its own, the mind may witness it as it is, with equanimity or distort it with craving or aversion. Knowing if the mind is witnessing objectively or distorting what has arisen is experiencing *cittasaṅkhāra*.

*8. ‘passambhayaṁ cittasaṅkhāraṁ assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, 'passambhayaṁ cittasaṅkhāraṁ passasissāmī’ti sikkhati.*

He practices thus: 'I will be aware of the mind coming to a state where the conditioned automatic reactions (*cittasaṅkhāra*) of the mind are calmed', 'I will be aware of the mind going out of a state where the conditioned automatic reactions of the mind are calmed'.

> When *cittasaṅkhāra* calms down, the mind witnesses whatever arises on its own from the mind or through the sense doors with equanimity or with minimal distortion. 
> For example, when an old memory flashes or comes in through a sense door, the mind clings to it relentlessly and reacts based on past conditioning. This process of clinging and reacting is called *cittasaṅkhāra*. Passambhayaṁ cittasaṅkhāraṁ means calming down that reaction process. 

*9. ‘Cittapaṭisaṁvedī assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘cittapaṭisaṁvedī passasissāmī’ti sikkhati; *

He practices thus: 'I will be aware of coming to a state of mind where the mind experiences (undistorted) mind(*citta*); I will be aware of going out of a state of mind where the mind experiences (undistorted) mind(*citta*)'

> The mind is a storehouse of past conditioning that keeps surfacing relentlessly, preventing it from abiding in its natural state of stillness. Now that the *cittasaṅkhāra* has calmed down, the mind can witness its contents without any distortions.  

*10. ''abhippamodayaṁ cittaṁ assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, 'abhippamodayaṁ cittaṁ passasissāmī’ti sikkhati; *

He practices thus: 'I will be aware of coming to a state of gladdening of the mind; I will be aware of going out of a state of gladdening of the mind'

> When the mind begins to witness the truth, whatever is coming in through the sense doors or from the mind, with equanimity, a sublime happiness sets in. 

*11. ‘samādahaṁ cittaṁ assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘samādahaṁ cittaṁ passasissāmī’ti sikkhati; *

He practices thus: 'I will be aware of coming to a state of mind where the mind is becoming one or a whole; I will be aware of going out of a state of mind where the mind is becoming one or a whole'.

> This is the process of putting together the pieces of the mind, the mind becoming one, a mind with no conflict. In everyday life, our minds are constantly at odds with themselves and are fragmented. The mind is torn between anger and the desire to escape it. This internal conflict arises because the mind is fragmented, lacking wholeness. 

*12. ‘vimocayaṁ cittaṁ assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘vimocayaṁ cittaṁ passasissāmī’ti sikkhati.*

He practices thus: 'I will be aware of coming to a state of mind where the mind is experiencing complete freedom; I will be aware of going out of a state of mind where the mind is experiencing complete freedom'.

> A mind in complete freedom is not affected by the stimuli that it is receiving, either through the sense doors or through the mind.

*13. ‘Aniccānupassī assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘aniccānupassī passasissāmī’ti sikkhati;*

He practices thus: 'I will be aware of coming to a state of mind where the mind is seeing impermanence continuously; I will be aware of going out of a state of mind where the mind is seeing impermanence continuously'.

>  As the mind witnesses reality as it is, the arising of different stimuli, its effects on the ego, and its passing away, the mind realises that everything is impermanent. It becomes apparent that the coming of "I" is not in any way special, and is just another thought. There is no difference between the observer and the observed. The "I" or observer also comes into being dependent on some conditions and passes away in time, only to be reborn again. Witnessing this entire phenomenon is *Aniccānupassī*.

*14. ‘virāgānupassī assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘virāgānupassī passasissāmī’ti sikkhati;*

He practices thus: 'I will be aware of coming to a state of mind where the mind is seeing dispassion continuously; I will be aware of going out of a state of mind where the mind is seeing dispassion continuously'.

> Having witnessed that everything about the body and mind is impermanent, dispassion is the natural progression. It no longer matters what kind of stimuli are received. There is a stimulus, and it is being witnessed. 

*15. ‘nirodhānupassī assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘nirodhānupassī passasissāmī’ti sikkhati;*

He practices thus: 'I will be aware of coming to a state of mind where the mind is seeing cessation (of stimuli that the mind is receiving) continuously; I will be aware of going out of a state of mind where the mind is seeing cessation (of stimuli that the mind is receiving) continuously'.

> The mind no longer perceives or receives any stimuli. It simply acts as a witness—total cessation. 

*16. ‘paṭinissaggānupassī assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘paṭinissaggānupassī passasissāmī’ti sikkhati.*

He practices as follows: 'I will be aware of reaching a state of mind where the mind is witness to total abandonment continuously; I will be aware of leaving a state of mind where the mind is witness to total abandonment continuously.'

*Evaṁ bhāvitā kho, bhikkhave, ānāpānassati evaṁ bahulīkatā mahapphalā hoti mahānisaṁsā.*

Monks! Thus repeatedly developed, *ānāpānassati* yields great fruits and is of great benefit. 

*Kathaṁ bhāvitā ca, bhikkhave, ānāpānassati kathaṁ bahulīkatā cattāro satipaṭṭhāne paripūreti?*

How does *ānāpānassati*, when repeatedly developed, lead to fulfilling the four foundations of mindfulness? 

*Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhu dīghaṁ vā assasanto ... passasissāmī’ti sikkhati; kāye kāyānupassī, bhikkhave, tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ.*

Monks, when a monk is practising steps 1-4 (dīghaṁ .. sikkhati), at that time he is witnessing the body within the body ardently mindful of whatever is happening at that moment and getting rid of wandering thoughts and negative states of mind. 

*Kāyesu kāyaññatarāhaṁ, bhikkhave, evaṁ vadāmi yadidaṁ—assāsapassāsā. Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, kāye kāyānupassī tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ.*

Monks, I say *assāsapassāsā*, the process of coming into and going out of reality-body is one among the various bodies. Hence, at that time, when he witnesses the body within the body, he is ardently mindful of whatever is happening at that moment, eliminating wandering thoughts and negative states of mind. 

*Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ‘pītipaṭisaṁvedī assasissāmī’ti ... passasissāmī’ti sikkhati; vedanāsu vedanānupassī, bhikkhave, tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ.*

Monks, when a monk is practising steps 5-8 (pītipaṭisaṁvedī ... sikkhati), at that time he is witnessing the feeling within the feeling ardently mindful of whatever is happening at that moment and getting rid of wandering thoughts and negative states of mind. 

*Vedanāsu vedanāññatarāhaṁ, bhikkhave, evaṁ vadāmi yadidaṁ—assāsapassāsānaṁ sādhukaṁ manasikāraṁ. Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, vedanāsu vedanānupassī tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ.*

I say paying total attention (to the causes) of the process of coming into and going out of reality *assāsapassāsā* is witnessing the feeling within the feeling. Thus, at that time, when he becomes aware of the feeling within the feeling, he is ardently mindful of whatever is happening in that moment and eliminates wandering thoughts and negative states of mind. 

*Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ‘cittapaṭisaṁvedī assasissāmī'... passasissāmī’ti sikkhati; citte cittānupassī, bhikkhave, tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ.*

Monks, when a monk is practising steps 9-12 (cittapaṭisaṁvedī ... sikkhati), at that time he is witnessing the mind within the mind, ardently mindful of whatever is happening at that moment and eliminating wandering thoughts and negative states of mind. 

*Nāhaṁ, bhikkhave, muṭṭhassatissa asampajānassa ānāpānassatiṁ vadāmi. Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, citte cittānupassī tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ.*

I do not say someone is accomplished in ānāpānassati when they have intermittent, incomplete awareness. Thus, at that time, he is witnessing the mind within the mind, ardently mindful of whatever is happening at that moment and eliminating wandering thoughts and negative states of mind. 

*Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ‘aniccānupassī assasissām ... passasissāmī’ti sikkhati; dhammesu dhammānupassī, bhikkhave, tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ.*

Monks, when a monk is practising steps 13-16(aniccānupassī ... sikkhati), at that time he is witnessing the truth or nature of reality within the truth or nature of reality, ardently mindful of whatever is happening at that moment and eliminating wandering thoughts and negative states of mind. 

*So yaṁ taṁ abhijjhādomanassānaṁ pahānaṁ taṁ paññāya disvā sādhukaṁ ajjhupekkhitā hoti. Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, dhammesu dhammānupassī tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ.*

He who eliminates wandering thoughts and negative states of mind sees with wisdom and is in complete equanimity. Thus, at that time, he is witnessing the truth or nature of reality within the truth, ardently mindful of whatever is happening at that moment and eliminating wandering thoughts and negative states of mind. 

*Evaṁ bhāvitā kho, bhikkhave, ānāpānassati evaṁ bahulīkatā cattāro satipaṭṭhāne paripūreti.*

Monks! Thus developed repeatedly, *ānāpānassati* fulfils the four foundations of mindfulness.

*Kathaṁ bhāvitā ca, bhikkhave, cattāro satipaṭṭhānā kathaṁ bahulīkatā satta bojjhaṅge paripūrenti?*

Monks! How does fulfilling the four foundations of mindfulness fulfil the seven factors of Awakening? 

*Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kāye kāyānupassī viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ, upaṭṭhitāssa tasmiṁ samaye sati hoti asammuṭṭhā. Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno upaṭṭhitā sati hoti asammuṭṭhā, satisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho hoti. Satisambojjhaṅgaṁ tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu bhāveti, satisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchati.*

Monks! When a monk observes the body within the body with total mindfulness of the present moment and eliminates wandering thoughts and negative states of mind, the constant mindfulness becomes clear and unmuddled. At such times, the awakening factor of mindfulness arises in the monk. The monk cultivates and brings this awakening factor of mindfulness to fruition.

*So tathāsato viharanto taṁ dhammaṁ paññāya pavicinati pavicayati parivīmaṁsaṁ āpajjati. Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhu tathāsato viharanto taṁ dhammaṁ paññāya pavicinati pavicayati parivīmaṁsaṁ āpajjati, dhammavicayasambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho hoti, dhammavicayasambojjhaṅgaṁ tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu bhāveti, dhammavicayasambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchati.*

When he thus mindfully dwells, he engages in a thorough investigation of the truth or nature of reality. At such times, the awakening factor of investigating the truth awakens in him. The monk develops the awakening factor of investigating the truth and brings it to fulfilment. 

*Tassa taṁ dhammaṁ paññāya pavicinato pavicayato parivīmaṁsaṁ āpajjato āraddhaṁ hoti vīriyaṁ asallīnaṁ. Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno taṁ dhammaṁ paññāya pavicinato pavicayato parivīmaṁsaṁ āpajjato āraddhaṁ hoti vīriyaṁ asallīnaṁ, vīriyasambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho hoti, vīriyasambojjhaṅgaṁ tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu bhāveti, vīriyasambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchati.*

When he engages in a thorough investigation of the truth or nature of reality, active energy is aroused in him. As a result, the awakening factor of effort awakens in him. The monk cultivates the awakening factor of investigating the truth and brings it to fruition. 

*Āraddhavīriyassa uppajjati pīti nirāmisā. Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno āraddhavīriyassa uppajjati pīti nirāmisā, pītisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho hoti, pītisambojjhaṅgaṁ tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu bhāveti, pītisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchati.*

Through aroused effort, pure joy is born. When this occurs, the awakening factor of Joy awakens in him. The monk cultivates the awakening factor of Joy and brings it to fruition. 

*Pītimanassa kāyopi passambhati, cittampi passambhati. Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno pītimanassa kāyopi passambhati, cittampi passambhati, passaddhisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho hoti, passaddhisambojjhaṅgaṁ tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu bhāveti, passaddhisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchati.*

When the mind is filled with joy, the body and mind become calm and tranquil. When the monk's mind is filled with joy, his body and mind become calm and tranquil, and the awakening factor of Tranquillity awakens within him. The monk cultivates the awakening factor of Tranquillity and brings it to fruition.  

*Passaddhakāyassa sukhino cittaṁ samādhiyati. Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno passaddhakāyassa sukhino cittaṁ samādhiyati, samādhisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho hoti, samādhisambojjhaṅgaṁ tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu bhāveti, samādhisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchati.*

When the body becomes calm and tranquil, experiencing peace, the mind also becomes composed and unified. At that moment, the awakening factor of Samadhi—the stillness of the mind—arises within him. The monk cultivates the awakening factor of Samadhi—the stillness of the mind—and brings it to fulfilment or fruition. 

*So tathāsamāhitaṁ cittaṁ sādhukaṁ ajjhupekkhitā hoti. Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhu tathāsamāhitaṁ cittaṁ sādhukaṁ ajjhupekkhitā hoti, upekkhāsambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho hoti, upekkhāsambojjhaṅgaṁ tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu bhāveti, upekkhāsambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchati.*

Thus, the unified mind is in complete equanimity. When the unified mind reaches this state, the awakening factor of equanimity arises within him. The monk develops the awakening factor of equanimity and brings it to fulfilment. 

*Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vedanāsu …pe… citte … dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ, upaṭṭhitāssa tasmiṁ samaye sati hoti asammuṭṭhā. Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno upaṭṭhitā sati hoti asammuṭṭhā, satisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho hoti, satisambojjhaṅgaṁ tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu bhāveti, satisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchati. *

Monks! When a monk observes the feeling within the feeling, the mind within the mind, and the truth within the truth, with complete mindfulness of the present moment, and eliminates wandering thoughts and negative states of mind, the constant mindfulness becomes clear and unmuddled. At such times, the awakening factor of mindfulness arises in the monk. The monk cultivates and brings this awakening factor of mindfulness to fruition.

*So tathāsato viharanto taṁ dhammaṁ paññāya pavicinati pavicayati parivīmaṁsaṁ āpajjati. Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhu tathāsato viharanto taṁ dhammaṁ paññāya pavicinati pavicayati parivīmaṁsaṁ āpajjati, dhammavicayasambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho hoti, dhammavicayasambojjhaṅgaṁ tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu bhāveti, dhammavicayasambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchati. *

When he thus mindfully dwells, he engages in a thorough investigation of the truth or nature of reality. At such times, the awakening factor of investigating the truth awakens in him. The monk cultivates and brings this awakening factor of investigating the truth to fruition.

*Tassa taṁ dhammaṁ paññāya pavicinato pavicayato parivīmaṁsaṁ āpajjato āraddhaṁ hoti vīriyaṁ asallīnaṁ. Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno taṁ dhammaṁ paññāya pavicinato pavicayato parivīmaṁsaṁ āpajjato āraddhaṁ hoti vīriyaṁ asallīnaṁ, vīriyasambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho hoti, vīriyasambojjhaṅgaṁ tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu bhāveti, vīriyasambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchati. *

When he engages in a thorough investigation of the truth or nature of reality, active energy is aroused in him. As a result, the awakening factor of effort awakens in him. The monk cultivates the awakening factor of investigating the truth and brings it to fruition. 

*Āraddhavīriyassa uppajjati pīti nirāmisā. Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno āraddhavīriyassa uppajjati pīti nirāmisā, pītisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho hoti, pītisambojjhaṅgaṁ tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu bhāveti, pītisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchati. *

Through aroused effort, pure joy is born. When this occurs, the awakening factor of Joy awakens in him. The monk cultivates the awakening factor of Joy and brings it to fruition. 

*Pītimanassa kāyopi passambhati, cittampi passambhati. Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno pītimanassa kāyopi passambhati, cittampi passambhati, passaddhisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho hoti, passaddhisambojjhaṅgaṁ tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu bhāveti, passaddhisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchati. *

When the mind is filled with joy, the body and mind become calm and tranquil. When the monk's mind is filled with joy, his body and mind become calm and tranquil, and the awakening factor of Tranquillity awakens within him. The monk cultivates the awakening factor of Tranquillity and brings it to fruition.  

*Passaddhakāyassa sukhino cittaṁ samādhiyati. Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno passaddhakāyassa sukhino cittaṁ samādhiyati, samādhisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho hoti, samādhisambojjhaṅgaṁ tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu bhāveti, samādhisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchati. *

When the body becomes calm and tranquil, experiencing peace, the mind also becomes composed and unified. At that moment, the awakening factor of Samadhi—the stillness of the mind—arises within him. The monk cultivates the awakening factor of Samadhi—the stillness of the mind—and brings it to fulfilment or fruition. 

*So tathāsamāhitaṁ cittaṁ sādhukaṁ ajjhupekkhitā hoti. Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhu tathāsamāhitaṁ cittaṁ sādhukaṁ ajjhupekkhitā hoti, upekkhāsambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho hoti, upekkhāsambojjhaṅgaṁ tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu bhāveti, upekkhāsambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchati.*

Thus, the unified mind is in complete equanimity. When the unified mind reaches this state, the awakening factor of equanimity arises within him. The monk develops the awakening factor of equanimity and brings it to fulfilment. 

*Evaṁ bhāvitā kho, bhikkhave, cattāro satipaṭṭhānā evaṁ bahulīkatā satta sambojjhaṅge paripūrenti.*

 Thus, repeatedly cultivating the four foundations of mindfulness fulfils the seven factors of Awakening.

*Kathaṁ bhāvitā ca, bhikkhave, satta bojjhaṅgā kathaṁ bahulīkatā vijjāvimuttiṁ paripūrenti?*

Monks! How does repeatedly cultivating the seven factors of Awakening fulfil complete watchfulness and freedom?

*Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu satisambojjhaṅgaṁ bhāveti vivekanissitaṁ virāganissitaṁ nirodhanissitaṁ vossaggapariṇāmiṁ. Dhammavicayasambojjhaṅgaṁ bhāveti …pe… vīriyasambojjhaṅgaṁ bhāveti … pītisambojjhaṅgaṁ bhāveti … passaddhisambojjhaṅgaṁ bhāveti … samādhisambojjhaṅgaṁ bhāveti …*

Monks! A monk develops the awakening factor of mindfulness by relying on discrimination, dispassion, and cessation, ultimately leading to complete letting go. ....

*upekkhāsambojjhaṅgaṁ bhāveti vivekanissitaṁ virāganissitaṁ nirodhanissitaṁ vossaggapariṇāmiṁ.*

A monk cultivates the awakening factor of equanimity, relying on discrimination, dispassion, and cessation, which leads to complete letting go.

*Evaṁ bhāvitā kho, bhikkhave, satta bojjhaṅgā evaṁ bahulīkatā vijjāvimuttiṁ paripūrentī”ti.*

Thus, repeatedly cultivating the seven factors of Awakening fulfils knowledge through watchfulness and freedom.

*Idamavoca bhagavā. Attamanā te bhikkhū bhagavato bhāsitaṁ abhinandunti.*

Thus the noble one spoke. The monks approved and were delighted by what the blessed one spoke.
