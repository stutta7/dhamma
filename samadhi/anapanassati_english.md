Monks, Ānāpānassati, when repeatedly practised, lead to great results and are of great benefit. Ānāpānassati, when repeatedly practised, fulfils the four foundations of mindfulness. The four foundations of mindfulness, when repeatedly practised, fulfil the seven factors of Awakening. The seven factors of Awakening, when repeatedly practised, fulfil *Vijja* and freedom. 

<sub>Kathaṁ bhāvitā ca, bhikkhave, ānāpānassati kathaṁ bahulīkatā mahapphalā hoti mahānisaṁsā</sub>

How is Ānāpānassati, when repeatedly practised, leads to great results and is of great benefit?

<sub>Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu araññagato vā rukkhamūlagato vā suññāgāragato vā nisīdati pallaṅkaṁ ābhujitvā ujuṁ kāyaṁ paṇidhāya parimukhaṁ satiṁ upaṭṭhapetvā</sub>

That is when a monk goes to the forest or the root of a tree or to a secluded hut, sits with his legs folded in a comfortable posture with his body erect and focuses his attention in front (whatever comes in the field of his awareness).

<sub>So satova assasati satova passasati</sub>

They are mindfully aware of the coming in and the going out of the awareness.

> **Practise Note:**
>
> Awareness abiding inwardly: Awareness turns inward, becoming watchful of its state. Presence is strengthening.  
> Awareness drifting outward: Awareness is caught in the thought world, grasping objects or reacting to stimuli. Presence is weakening.

<sub>1. Dīghaṁ vā assasanto ‘dīghaṁ assasāmī’ti pajānāti, dīghaṁ vā passasanto ‘dīghaṁ passasāmī’ti pajānāti</sub>

When awareness abides inwardly for a long time, they know, “awareness abides inwardly for a long time.” When awareness drifts outward for a long time, they know, “awareness has drifted outward for a long time.”

> **Practise Note:**
> When one realises that awareness has been within the body or in reality for a long time, they know that awareness has been turned inwards for a long time. When one realises that the awareness is drifting in thoughts for a long time, they know the awareness is turned outwards for a long time.

<sub>2. rassaṁ vā assasanto ‘rassaṁ assasāmī’ti pajānāti, rassaṁ vā passasanto ‘rassaṁ passasāmī’ti pajānāti</sub>

When awareness abides inwardly for a short time, they know, “awareness abides inwardly for a short time.” When awareness drifts outward for a short time, they know, “awareness has drifted outward for a short time.”

> **Practise Note:**
> Every step has two parts: the first part is about recognising the inward journey/strengthening of awareness, and once sustained, it will lead the monk/trainee to the next step. The second part is about recognising the outward journey/drifting of the awareness, or a regression, and hence may lead to one of the previous steps. If one recognises the drifting of the awareness early enough, that in itself is enough to move the awareness towards the inward journey/strengthening. Only if one misses the drifting of the awareness for some time does it cause a regression. 

<sub>3. ‘sabbakāyapaṭisaṁvedī assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘sabbakāyapaṭisaṁvedī passasissāmī’ti sikkhati</sub>

They practise: “I will be aware of experiencing or abiding with the whole body; I will be aware of losing the whole-body experience.”

>  **Practice Note:**
> This is when one is aware of everything as it happens within the whole body. It enables one to stay with awareness for more extended periods. The awareness of everything as it happens is due to the mind not grasping any object. When the mind grasps an object, it ignores whatever is happening in the rest of the body, and awareness starts to drift into reacting and then into thoughts. This is also a state where you are aware of the whole body, rather than just a part of it; more like looking at the entire map instead of one's home.

<sub>4. 'passambhayaṁ kāyasaṅkhāraṁ assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, 'passambhayaṁ kāyasaṅkhāraṁ passasissāmī’ti sikkhati</sub>

They practice: “I will be aware of the calming of the kāyasaṅkhāra - the oscillation of awareness between abiding inwardly and drifting outward.”,  “I will be aware when the calm of this oscillation is lost.”

> **Practice Note:**
> *kāyasaṅkhāra* is also referred to as *assāsapassāsa*, the process of awareness abiding in the body or drifting into thoughts. In this step, the awareness strengthens and abides within the body for longer & longer durations. The drifts into the thought world reduce. 

> **Practice Note: kāyānupassana**
> **Tension:** Awareness oscillates between abiding in the body and drifting into thoughts.
> **Resolution:** With the calming of kāyasaṅkhāra, awareness settles more steadily in the body. Drifting reduces, presence stabilises.

<sub>5. 'Pītipaṭisaṁvedī assasissāmī'ti sikkhati, 'pītipaṭisaṁvedī passasissāmī'ti sikkhati;</sub>

They practice: “I will be aware of experiencing pīti.”, “I will be aware that I am no longer  experiencing pīti.”

> **Practice Note:**
> *Pīti* is a natural progression as awareness abides within the body. It is energising and uplifting in nature(may feel like goosebumps) in response to wholesome states. The usual distractions are receding, and one can witness more clearly. With pīti, one can view pleasant and painful experiences on the body and mind with greater objectivity and avoid becoming emotionally attached. 

<sub>6. ‘sukhapaṭisaṁvedī assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘sukhapaṭisaṁvedī passasissāmī’ti sikkhati</sub>

They practice: “I will be aware of experiencing sukha.”, “I will be aware that I am no longer  experiencing sukha.”

> **Practice Note:**
> *Sukha* is a more subtle state than the *piti*, one in which there is a beginning of stillness. The description of the welling up of cold water in a still lake is apt in describing this state. In this state, the meditator will be able to look at the most painful experiences with relative ease. 

<sub>7. ‘cittasaṅkhārapaṭisaṁvedī assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘cittasaṅkhārapaṭisaṁvedī passasissāmī’ti sikkhati</sub>

They practice: 'I will be aware of experiencing *cittasaṅkhāra* - conditioned automatic reactions of the mind; I will be aware that I am no longer experiencing *cittasaṅkhāra*;'

> **Practice Note:**
> *cittasaṅkhāra* or conditioned automatic reactions of the mind are the distortions that our conditioning adds to whatever is arising on its own from the mind or through the sense doors. This conditioning happens as follows: _saññā_ recognises & _vedanā_ colours the experience as pleasant or unpleasant. From there, craving or aversion often erupts. When something arises on its own, one may witness it as it is with equanimity or distort it with craving or aversion. Knowing if one is distorting what has arisen is experiencing *cittasaṅkhāra*.

<sub>8. ‘passambhayaṁ cittasaṅkhāraṁ assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, 'passambhayaṁ cittasaṅkhāraṁ passasissāmī’ti sikkhati</sub>

They practice: “I will be aware of the calming of the *cittasaṅkhāra* - conditioned automatic reactions of the mind.”,  “I will be aware when the calm of *cittasaṅkhāra* is lost.”

> **Practice Note:**
> When *cittasaṅkhāra* calms down, the mind witnesses whatever arises on its own from the mind or through the sense doors with equanimity or with minimal distortion. 
> For example, when an old memory flashes or comes in through a sense door, the mind may cling to it relentlessly and react based on past conditioning or witness equanimously. This process of clinging and reacting is called *cittasaṅkhāra*. Passambhayaṁ cittasaṅkhāraṁ is the calming down of the reaction process. 

> **Practice Note: vedanānupassana**
> **Tension:** Awareness is pulled between reacting through conditioning (saññā + vedanā → craving/aversion) and witnessing equanimously.
> **Resolution:** As _cittasaṅkhāra_ (reactive patterning) calms, awareness remains equanimous, free from distortion.

<sub>9. ‘Cittapaṭisaṁvedī assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘cittapaṭisaṁvedī passasissāmī’ti sikkhati;</sub>

They practice: 'I will be aware of experiencing mind(*citta*) as it is, undistorted; I will be aware that I am no longer experiencing mind(*citta*) as it is, undistorted'

> **Practice Note:**
> The mind is a storehouse of past conditioning that keeps surfacing relentlessly, preventing awareness from abiding in its natural state of stillness. Now that the distortions the mind adds (*cittasaṅkhāra*) have calmed down, one can witness the mind without any distortions.
> Old memories surface from the mind; one is not attached to it, shows no reaction, so they pass away. More & more memories keep surfacing as there is no longer any resistance to the process. 

<sub>10. 'abhippamodayaṁ cittaṁ assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, 'abhippamodayaṁ cittaṁ passasissāmī’ti sikkhati;</sub>

They practice: 'I will be aware of the gladdening of the mind; I will be aware of going out of a state of gladdening of the mind'

> **Practice Note:**
> When the mind begins to witness the truth, whatever is coming in through the sense doors or from the mind, with equanimity, a sublime happiness sets in. 

<sub>11. ‘samādahaṁ cittaṁ assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘samādahaṁ cittaṁ passasissāmī’ti sikkhati;</sub>

They practice: 'I will be aware of the mind becoming one; I will be aware that the mind is no longer one or a whole'.

> **Practice Note:**
> This is the process of putting together the scattered pieces of the mind, allowing it to become one. A samahita citta does not distort with conditioning, nor does it add anything by way of choosing or setting a goal. The moment the mind has a goal, the citta is no longer one, and it distorts the truth. Venerable Ānanda’s awakening shows this vividly. As long as he _strove_ to attain arahantship, the striving itself prevented him from achieving it. Only when the mind let go of striving by not adding a goal did it become transparent, and awakening occurred.

<sub>12. ‘vimocayaṁ cittaṁ assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘vimocayaṁ cittaṁ passasissāmī’ti sikkhati</sub>

They practice:  'I will be aware of the mind experiencing complete freedom; I will be aware that the mind is no longer experiencing complete freedom'.

> **Practice Note:**
> A mind in complete freedom is not affected by the stimuli, nor does it add anything to what it receives through any of the sense doors, including the mind.

> **Practice Note: cittānupassana**
> **Tension:** The mind moves between choosing and goal-setting versus resting in choiceless awareness. 
> **Resolution:** Only when all goals (even noble ones) are released and become choiceless does the citta become samāhita (unified, collected). The mind becomes transparent, whole and totally free. 

<sub>13. ‘Aniccānupassī assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘aniccānupassī passasissāmī’ti sikkhati</sub>

They practice: 'I will be aware of witnessing impermanence, moment to moment; I will be aware that I am no longer witnessing impermanence, moment to moment'.

>  **Practice Note:**
> As the awareness or witnessing of the reality as it is becomes moment to moment, with the arising of different stimuli, their effects on the ego, and their passing away, it becomes clear that everything is impermanent. It becomes apparent that the coming of "I" is not in any way special and is like any other thought. There is no difference between the observer and the observed. The ‘I’ is seen as just another impermanent process, arising and passing like all other conditions. Witnessing this is aniccānupassanā.

<sub>14. ‘virāgānupassī assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘virāgānupassī passasissāmī’ti sikkhati</sub>

They practice: 'I will be aware of witnessing dispassion, moment to moment; I will be aware that I am no longer witnessing dispassion, moment to moment'.

> **Practice Note:**
> Having witnessed that everything about the body and mind is impermanent, dispassion is the natural progression. There is nothing in the world for such a person to get attached to. It no longer matters what kind of stimuli are received. There is a stimulus, and it is being witnessed. 

<sub>15. ‘nirodhānupassī assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘nirodhānupassī passasissāmī’ti sikkhati</sub>

They practice:  'I will be aware of witnessing cessation of phenomena, moment to moment; I will be aware that I am no longer witnessing cessation of phenomena, moment to moment'.

> **Practice Note:**
> Here, awareness remains, but stimuli no longer present themselves. What is left is pure witnessing - the cessation of objects. 

<sub>16. ‘paṭinissaggānupassī assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘paṭinissaggānupassī passasissāmī’ti sikkhati</sub>

He practices as follows: 'I will be aware of total abandonment, moment to moment; I will be aware of leaving a state of total abandonment, moment to moment.'

> **Practice Note:**
> One may reach the state of cessation for a short duration. However, to become a fully awakened person, all past conditioning must be witnessed and dispassionately let go. Once the journey is complete, there is no past conditioning left, and the person becomes fully awakened. 

>**Practice Note: dhammānupassana**
>**Tension:** The shift in the frame of awareness from pleasant/unpleasant or observer/observed or self-centred to seeing everything as impermanent.
>**Resolution:** When impermanence is seen moment to moment, dispassion arises, then cessation, then relinquishment. Nothing remains to cling to.

<sub>Evaṁ bhāvitā kho, bhikkhave, ānāpānassati evaṁ bahulīkatā mahapphalā hoti mahānisaṁsā</sub>

Monks! Thus repeatedly developed, *ānāpānassati* yields great fruits and is of great benefit. 

<sub>Kathaṁ bhāvitā ca, bhikkhave, ānāpānassati kathaṁ bahulīkatā cattāro satipaṭṭhāne paripūreti</sub>

How does *ānāpānassati*, when repeatedly developed, lead to fulfilling the four foundations of mindfulness? 

<sub>Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhu dīghaṁ vā assasanto ... passasissāmī’ti sikkhati; kāye kāyānupassī, bhikkhave, tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ</sub>

Monks, when a monk is practising steps 1-4 (dīghaṁ .. sikkhati), at that time, contemplating body as body, they dwell ardent (_ātāpī_), comprehending without distortion (_sampajāno_), and mindful (_satimā_), having abandoned craving for the pleasant and aversion for the unpleasant toward whatever arises within the field of awareness in the body (_vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ_).

>**Practice Note:**
>_Sampajāna_ means awareness is free of distortions by conditioning. It is not warped by the filters of saññā (recognition), vedanā (feeling). It sees what arises _as it is_, without colouring.
>Just as important, _sampajāna_ also implies _not adding anything_. No agenda, no hidden push toward any goal, say - “I want to become enlightened.” Even the most noble-sounding goal introduces distortion. _Sampajāna_ is what one knows in choiceless awareness. 

<sub>Kāyesu kāyaññatarāhaṁ, bhikkhave, evaṁ vadāmi yadidaṁ—assāsapassāsā. Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, kāye kāyānupassī tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ</sub>

Monks, I say *assāsapassāsā* - the ebb and flow of awareness, settling in the body and drifting into thought - is itself one aspect of the body. Therefore, at that time, contemplating body as body, they dwell ardent (_ātāpī_), comprehending without distortion of reaction (_sampajāno_), and mindful (_satimā_), having abandoned craving for the pleasant and aversion for the unpleasant toward whatever arises within the field of awareness in the body (_vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ_).

<sub>Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ‘pītipaṭisaṁvedī assasissāmī’ti ... passasissāmī’ti sikkhati; vedanāsu vedanānupassī, bhikkhave, tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ</sub>

Monks, when a monk is practising steps 5-8 (pītipaṭisaṁvedī ... sikkhati), at that time, contemplating body as body, they dwell ardent, comprehending without distortion of reaction, and mindful, having abandoned craving for the pleasant and aversion for the unpleasant toward whatever arises within the field of awareness in the body.

<sub>Vedanāsu vedanāññatarāhaṁ, bhikkhave, evaṁ vadāmi yadidaṁ—assāsapassāsānaṁ sādhukaṁ manasikāraṁ. Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, vedanāsu vedanānupassī tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ</sub>

Monks, I say that careful attention to the ebb and flow of awareness(_assāsapassāsā_) — whether reacting through conditioning or abiding with equanimity — is itself an aspect of feeling. Therefore, at that time, contemplating feeling as feeling, they dwell ardent, comprehending without distortion of reaction, and mindful, having abandoned craving for the pleasant and aversion for the unpleasant toward whatever arises within the field of awareness in the body.

<sub>Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ‘cittapaṭisaṁvedī assasissāmī'... passasissāmī’ti sikkhati; citte cittānupassī, bhikkhave, tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ</sub>

Monks, when a monk is practising steps 9-12 (cittapaṭisaṁvedī ... sikkhati), at that time, contemplating feeling as feeling, they dwell ardent, comprehending without distortion of reaction, and mindful, having abandoned craving for the pleasant and aversion for the unpleasant toward whatever arises within the field of awareness in the body.

<sub>Nāhaṁ, bhikkhave, muṭṭhassatissa asampajānassa ānāpānassatiṁ vadāmi. Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, citte cittānupassī tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ</sub>

“Monks, I do not call it ānāpānassati when awareness is intermittent (with lapses) or is distorted by conditioning or setting goals. Therefore, at that time, contemplating mind as mind, they dwell ardent, comprehending without distortion of reaction or a goal, and mindful, having abandoned craving for the pleasant and aversion for the unpleasant toward whatever arises within the field of awareness in the body.

<sub>Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhu ‘aniccānupassī assasissām ... passasissāmī’ti sikkhati; dhammesu dhammānupassī, bhikkhave, tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ</sub>

Monks, when a monk is practising steps 13-16(aniccānupassī ... sikkhati), at that time, contemplating dhamma as dhamma — witnessing the truth of things as they are, without distortion — they dwell ardent, comprehending without distortion of reaction, and mindful, having abandoned craving for the pleasant and aversion for the unpleasant toward whatever arises within the field of awareness in the body.

<sub>So yaṁ taṁ abhijjhādomanassānaṁ pahānaṁ taṁ paññāya disvā sādhukaṁ ajjhupekkhitā hoti. Tasmātiha, bhikkhave, dhammesu dhammānupassī tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu viharati ātāpī sampajāno satimā vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ</sub>

When a practitioner has abandoned craving for the pleasant and aversion for the unpleasant, they see with wisdom and remain in a steady state of equanimity. Therefore, at that time, contemplating dhamma as dhamma — witnessing the truth of things as they are, without distortion — they dwell ardent, comprehending without distortion, and mindful, having abandoned craving for the pleasant and aversion for the unpleasant toward whatever arises within the field of awareness in the body.

> **Practice Note:**  
> *Dhamma* here does not mean doctrine or teachings, but the innate nature of all phenomena as they present themselves in awareness. When seen without distortion, this nature reveals itself as impermanent (_anicca_), not-self (_anatta_), and unsatisfactory (_dukkha_). To witness _dhamma in dhamma_ is to stay present with phenomena exactly as they arise and cease, without adding craving, aversion, or delusion. This clear witnessing naturally leads toward dispassion (_virāga_) and cessation (_nirodha_), and ultimately to total abandonment (paṭinissaggā).

<sub>Evaṁ bhāvitā kho, bhikkhave, ānāpānassati evaṁ bahulīkatā cattāro satipaṭṭhāne paripūreti</sub>

Monks! Thus developed repeatedly, *ānāpānassati* fulfils the four foundations of mindfulness.

<sub>Kathaṁ bhāvitā ca, bhikkhave, cattāro satipaṭṭhānā kathaṁ bahulīkatā satta bojjhaṅge paripūrenti</sub>

Monks! How does fulfilling the four foundations of mindfulness fulfil the seven factors of Awakening?

Monks! When a monk contemplates the body as the body, they dwell ardent, comprehending without distortion, and mindful, having abandoned craving for the pleasant and aversion for the unpleasant toward whatever arises within the field of awareness in the body. At such a time, mindfulness is steady and unmuddled, and the awakening factor of mindfulness arises. They cultivate this awakening factor to fulfilment.

<sub>So tathāsato viharanto taṁ dhammaṁ paññāya pavicinati pavicayati parivīmaṁsaṁ āpajjati.

When the mind is filled with pīti, the body and mind become calm and tranquil. At such a time, the awakening factor of Tranquillity arises. They cultivate the awakening factor and bring it to fulfilment.  

<sub>Passaddhakāyassa sukhino cittaṁ samādhiyati.

When the body becomes calm and tranquil, experiencing peace, the mind also becomes composed and unified. At that moment, the awakening factor of Samadhi arises. The monk cultivates the awakening factor of Samadhi and brings it to fulfilment. 

<sub>So tathāsamāhitaṁ cittaṁ sādhukaṁ ajjhupekkhitā hoti.

Monks! When a monk observes the feeling within the feeling, the mind within the mind, and the dhamma (witnessing the truth of things) within the dhamma, they dwell ardent, comprehending without distortion, and mindful, having abandoned craving for the pleasant and aversion for the unpleasant toward whatever arises within the field of awareness in the body. At such a time, mindfulness is steady and unmuddled, and the awakening factor of mindfulness arises. They cultivate and bring this awakening factor to fulfilment.

When the mind is filled with pīti, the body and mind become calm and tranquil. At such a time, the awakening factor of Tranquillity arises. They cultivate the awakening factor and bring it to fulfilment.  

<sub>Passaddhakāyassa sukhino cittaṁ samādhiyati. Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhuno passaddhakāyassa sukhino cittaṁ samādhiyati, samādhisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho hoti, samādhisambojjhaṅgaṁ tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu bhāveti, samādhisambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchati.</sub>

When the body becomes calm and tranquil, experiencing peace, the mind also becomes composed and unified. At that moment, the awakening factor of Samadhi arises. The monk cultivates this awakening factor and brings it to fulfilment. 

<sub>So tathāsamāhitaṁ cittaṁ sādhukaṁ ajjhupekkhitā hoti. Yasmiṁ samaye, bhikkhave, bhikkhu tathāsamāhitaṁ cittaṁ sādhukaṁ ajjhupekkhitā hoti, upekkhāsambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno āraddho hoti, upekkhāsambojjhaṅgaṁ tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhu bhāveti, upekkhāsambojjhaṅgo tasmiṁ samaye bhikkhuno bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchati</sub>

Thus, the unified mind is in complete equanimity. When the unified mind reaches this state, the awakening factor of equanimity arises. They develop this awakening factor and bring it to fulfilment. 

<sub>Evaṁ bhāvitā kho, bhikkhave, cattāro satipaṭṭhānā evaṁ bahulīkatā satta sambojjhaṅge paripūrenti</sub>

 Thus, repeatedly cultivating the four foundations of mindfulness fulfils the seven factors of Awakening.

<sub>Kathaṁ bhāvitā ca, bhikkhave, satta bojjhaṅgā kathaṁ bahulīkatā vijjāvimuttiṁ paripūrenti</sub>

Monks! How does repeatedly cultivating the seven factors of Awakening fulfil knowledge and freedom?

<sub>Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu satisambojjhaṅgaṁ bhāveti vivekanissitaṁ virāganissitaṁ nirodhanissitaṁ vossaggapariṇāmiṁ. Dhammavicayasambojjhaṅgaṁ bhāveti …pe… vīriyasambojjhaṅgaṁ bhāveti … pītisambojjhaṅgaṁ bhāveti … passaddhisambojjhaṅgaṁ bhāveti … samādhisambojjhaṅgaṁ bhāveti </sub>

Monks! A monk develops the awakening factor of mindfulness by relying on discrimination(*vivekanissitaṁ*[^2]), dispassion, and cessation, ultimately leading to complete relinquishment. ....

<sub>upekkhāsambojjhaṅgaṁ bhāveti vivekanissitaṁ virāganissitaṁ nirodhanissitaṁ vossaggapariṇāmiṁ</sub>

A monk cultivates the awakening factor of equanimity, relying on discrimination, dispassion, and cessation, which leads to complete relinquishment.

<sub>Evaṁ bhāvitā kho, bhikkhave, satta bojjhaṅgā evaṁ bahulīkatā vijjāvimuttiṁ paripūrentī”ti</sub>

Thus, repeatedly cultivating the seven factors of Awakening fulfils knowledge through watchfulness and freedom.

<sub>Idamavoca bhagavā. Attamanā te bhikkhū bhagavato bhāsitaṁ abhinandunti</sub>

Thus the noble one spoke. The monks approved and were delighted by what the blessed one spoke.

[^2]: Translator's Note:  Vivekanissitaṁ is usually translated as "relying on seclusion." But here, the set of four *vivekanissitaṁ, virāganissitaṁ, nirodhanissitaṁ, vossaggapariṇāmiṁ* are referring to steps 13-16, or the fourth tetrad. Here, the word vivekanissitaṁ directly references step 13, which is moment-to-moment awareness of impermanence. In this context, it can not mean seclusion. It can only mean discrimination or discernment.
