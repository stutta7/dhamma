# Kāyagatāsatisutta
Majjhima Nikāya 119 [^1]

*Evaṁ me sutaṁ— ekaṁ samayaṁ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṁ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme.*

Thus I heard, at a time when the Buddha was near Sāvatthi, in the Jeta Forest, at Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. 

*Atha kho sambahulānaṁ bhikkhūnaṁ pacchābhattaṁ piṇḍapātapaṭikkantānaṁ upaṭṭhānasālāyaṁ sannisinnānaṁ sannipatitānaṁ ayamantarākathā udapādi:*

A group of monks has gathered in a hall after returning from an alms round and finishing their meals. Then a conversation started between them: 

*“acchariyaṁ, āvuso, abbhutaṁ, āvuso. Yāvañcidaṁ tena bhagavatā jānatā passatā arahatā sammāsambuddhena kāyagatāsati bhāvitā bahulīkatā mahapphalā vuttā mahānisaṁsā”ti. *

Reverend! It is marvellous and wonderful that *Kāyagatāsati*, extolled by the Buddha—one who knows and sees, the extinguished, the fully awakened one—when developed, is of great benefit and produces excellent results.

*Ayañca hidaṁ tesaṁ bhikkhūnaṁ antarākathā vippakatā hoti, atha kho bhagavā sāyanhasamayaṁ paṭisallānā vuṭṭhito yena upaṭṭhānasālā tenupasaṅkami; upasaṅkamitvā paññatte āsane nisīdi. *

In this case, the conversation between the monks was interrupted. The Buddha emerged from his day's meditation in the evening and approached the meeting hall. He sat on the seat that had been arranged for him.

*Nisajja kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi: “kāya nuttha, bhikkhave, etarahi kathāya sannisinnā, kā ca pana vo antarākathā vippakatā”ti?*

Having sat down, the Buddha addressed the monks as such: "Monks! What was the conversation that was interrupted while you were sitting together and discussing?"

*“Idha, bhante, amhākaṁ pacchābhattaṁ piṇḍapātapaṭikkantānaṁ upaṭṭhānasālāyaṁ sannisinnānaṁ sannipatitānaṁ ayamantarākathā udapādi: ‘acchariyaṁ, āvuso, abbhutaṁ, āvuso. Yāvañcidaṁ tena bhagavatā jānatā passatā arahatā sammāsambuddhena kāyagatāsati bhāvitā bahulīkatā mahapphalā vuttā mahānisaṁsā’ti. Ayaṁ kho no, bhante, antarākathā vippakatā, atha bhagavā anuppatto”ti.*

The monks describe what they have been discussing. The Buddha addresses the monks thus: 

*“Kathaṁ bhāvitā ca, bhikkhave, kāyagatāsati kathaṁ bahulīkatā mahapphalā hoti mahānisaṁsā? *

"How is kāyagatāsati when developed and repeatedly practised leads to great results and is of great benefit?"

*Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu araññagato vā rukkhamūlagato vā suññāgāragato vā nisīdati pallaṅkaṁ ābhujitvā ujuṁ kāyaṁ paṇidhāya parimukhaṁ satiṁ upaṭṭhapetvā. *

That is when a monk goes to the forest or the root of a tree or to a secluded hut, sits with his legs folded in a comfortable posture with his body erect and focuses his attention in front (of the mind).

*So satova assasati satova passasati; *

He is mindfully aware of the coming in and the going out (of the mind).

>The mind that is coming in: The mind is turning inwards, or becoming watchful of its state. Its self-awareness is increasing. 
>The mind that is going out: The mind is moving into the thought world. It is grasping the object in front of it or reacting to the stimuli. Its self-awareness is decreasing. 

1. *dīghaṁ vā assasanto ‘dīghaṁ assasāmī’ti pajānāti, dīghaṁ vā passasanto ‘dīghaṁ passasāmī’ti pajānāti; *

When the mind is coming in/turning inwards for a long time, he knows 'The mind is inside for a long time'. When the mind is going out for a long time, he knows 'The mind is outside for a long time'.

2. *rassaṁ vā assasanto ‘rassaṁ assasāmī’ti pajānāti, rassaṁ vā passasanto ‘rassaṁ passasāmī’ti pajānāti; *

When the mind is coming in/turning inwards for a short time, he knows 'The mind is inside for a short time'. When the mind is going out for a short time, he knows 'The mind is outside for a short time'.

> Every step has two parts, the first part is about recognising the inward journey of the mind, and once sustained, will lead the monk/trainee to the next step. The second part is about recognising the outward journey of the mind, or a regression, and hence will lead to one of the previous steps. 

3. *‘sabbakāyapaṭisaṁvedī assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘sabbakāyapaṭisaṁvedī passasissāmī’ti sikkhati; *

He practices thus: 'I will be aware of coming to a state of mind where the mind experiences the whole body.'  'I will be aware of going out of a state of mind where the mind experiences the whole body', thus he practices. 

> This is a state of mind where one is aware of everything as it happens within the whole body. It enables the mind to stay focused inward for more extended periods. The ability to be mindful of everything as it happens is due to the mind not grasping any object. A mind that grasps an object ignores whatever is happening in the rest of the body. 

4. *‘passambhayaṁ kāyasaṅkhāraṁ assasissāmī’ti sikkhati, ‘passambhayaṁ kāyasaṅkhāraṁ passasissāmī’ti sikkhati. *

He practices thus: "I will be aware of the mind coming to a state where the conditioned automatic reactions (*kāyasaṅkhāra*) of the body are calmed, I will be aware of the mind going out of a state where the conditioned automatic reactions of the body are calmed".

> Assume an itching sensation has begun, and in everyday life, the mind does not become aware of it. A conditioned automatic reaction (*kāyasaṅkhāra*) kicks in, which is to scratch it. Now, from step 3, the mind becomes aware of everything happening in the body, so it is aware of an itching sensation and the automatic response to scratch it subsides. Eventually, the physical pain, numbness in the legs and urges to move subside. The legs may become numb, but this is not felt at this stage. That is *passambhayaṁ kāyasaṅkhāraṁ*, the calming of the conditioned automatic reactions of the body.

*Tassa evaṁ appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato ye gehasitā sarasaṅkappā te pahīyanti.*

In this way, as they live diligently, continuously striving and determined, they eliminate thoughts about life in a family.

*Tesaṁ pahānā ajjhattameva cittaṁ santiṭṭhati sannisīdati ekodi hoti samādhiyati. *

As they abandon thoughts about life in a family, their mind remains still, settles down, becomes one, and is calmed.  

*Evaṁ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kāyagatāsatiṁ bhāveti. *

This is how *kāyagatāsati* is developed. 

*Puna caparaṁ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu gacchanto vā ‘gacchāmī’ti pajānāti, ṭhito vā ‘ṭhitomhī’ti pajānāti, nisinno vā ‘nisinnomhī’ti pajānāti, sayāno vā ‘sayānomhī’ti pajānāti. *

Furthermore, when a monk is walking, he is aware, 'I am walking.' When he stands, he is aware, 'I am standing.' When he sits, he is aware, 'I am sitting.' When he lies down, he is aware, 'I am lying down.'

*Yathā yathā vā panassa kāyo paṇihito hoti tathā tathā naṁ pajānāti. *

He is aware of the body's orientation in any position it assumes. 

*Tassa evaṁ appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato ye gehasitā sarasaṅkappā te pahīyanti. Tesaṁ pahānā ajjhattameva cittaṁ santiṭṭhati sannisīdati ekodi hoti samādhiyati. Evampi, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kāyagatāsatiṁ bhāveti.*

In this way, as they live diligently, continuously striving and determined, they eliminate thoughts about life in a family. As they abandon thoughts about life in a family, their mind remains still, settles down, becomes one, and is calmed. This is also how mindfulness of the body(*kāyagatāsati*) is developed. 

*Puna caparaṁ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu abhikkante paṭikkante sampajānakārī hoti, ālokite vilokite sampajānakārī hoti, samiñjite pasārite sampajānakārī hoti, saṅghāṭipattacīvaradhāraṇe sampajānakārī hoti, asite pīte khāyite sāyite sampajānakārī hoti, uccārapassāvakamme sampajānakārī hoti, gate ṭhite nisinne sutte jāgarite bhāsite tuṇhībhāve sampajānakārī hoti.*

Furthermore, a monk is aware when he is going forward or backwards, looking at or looking away, contracting or stretching the body, aware of wearing the robe, outer robe and holding the bowl, aware when he is eating, drinking, chewing, tasting, defecating, urinating, walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, awake, speaking, or being silent.

*Tassa evaṁ appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato ye gehasitā sarasaṅkappā te pahīyanti. Tesaṁ pahānā ajjhattameva cittaṁ santiṭṭhati sannisīdati ekodi hoti samādhiyati. Evampi, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kāyagatāsatiṁ bhāveti.*

In this way, as they live diligently, continuously striving and determined, they eliminate thoughts about life in a family. As they abandon thoughts about life in a family, their mind remains still, settles down, becomes one, and is calmed. This is also how mindfulness of the body(*kāyagatāsati*) is developed. 

*Puna caparaṁ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu imameva kāyaṁ uddhaṁ pādatalā adho kesamatthakā tacapariyantaṁ pūraṁ nānappakārassa asucino paccavekkhati:*

Furthermore, a monk regards this body, encompassing everything from the hair on the head to the feet, and everything in between, as comprising different types of impurities.

*‘atthi imasmiṁ kāye kesā lomā nakhā dantā taco maṁsaṁ nhāru aṭṭhi aṭṭhimiñjaṁ vakkaṁ hadayaṁ yakanaṁ kilomakaṁ pihakaṁ papphāsaṁ antaṁ antaguṇaṁ udariyaṁ karīsaṁ pittaṁ semhaṁ pubbo lohitaṁ sedo medo assu vasā kheḷo siṅghāṇikā lasikā muttan’ti. *

'Within this body are hair on the head, hair on the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, tendon, bone, skeleton, kidney, heart, liver, membrane, spleen, lungs, intestine, mesentery, undigested food, faeces, gallbladder, phlegm, blood, sweat, fat, tears, oil, saliva, snot, lubricant fluid in the joints, urine'.

*Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, ubhatomukhā putoḷi pūrā nānāvihitassa dhaññassa, seyyathidaṁ— sālīnaṁ vīhīnaṁ muggānaṁ māsānaṁ tilānaṁ taṇḍulānaṁ, tamenaṁ cakkhumā puriso muñcitvā paccavekkheyya: ‘ime sālī ime vīhī ime muggā ime māsā ime tilā ime taṇḍulā’ti; *

Monks, If there is a bag with two openings filled with various kinds of grains such as fine rice, wheat, green gram, bean, sesame, dehusked rice and a person opens the bag and looks inside with his own eyes, he would say: 'This is fine rice, this is wheat, this is green gram, this is bean, this is sesame, this is dehusked rice'

*evameva kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu imameva kāyaṁ uddhaṁ pādatalā adho kesamatthakā tacapariyantaṁ pūraṁ nānappakārassa asucino paccavekkhati: *

Monks! Similarly, a monk views his own body, from the hair on his head to the feet, as various types of impurities. 

*‘atthi imasmiṁ kāye kesā lomā nakhā dantā taco maṁsaṁ nhāru aṭṭhi aṭṭhimiñjaṁ vakkaṁ hadayaṁ yakanaṁ kilomakaṁ pihakaṁ papphāsaṁ antaṁ antaguṇaṁ udariyaṁ karīsaṁ pittaṁ semhaṁ pubbo lohitaṁ sedo medo assu vasā kheḷo siṅghāṇikā lasikā muttan’ti. *

'Within this body are hair on the head, hair on the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, tendon, bone, skeleton, kidney, heart, liver, membrane, spleen, lungs, intestine, mesentery, undigested food, faeces, gallbladder, phlegm, blood, sweat, fat, tears, oil, saliva, snot, lubricant fluid in the joints, urine'.

*Tassa evaṁ appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato ye gehasitā sarasaṅkappā te pahīyanti. Tesaṁ pahānā ajjhattameva cittaṁ santiṭṭhati sannisīdati ekodi hoti samādhiyati. Evampi, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kāyagatāsatiṁ bhāveti.*

In this way, as they live diligently, continuously striving and determined, they eliminate thoughts about life in a family. As they abandon thoughts about life in a family, their mind remains still, settles down, becomes one, and is calmed. This is also how mindfulness of the body(*kāyagatāsati*) is developed. 

*Puna caparaṁ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu imameva kāyaṁ yathāṭhitaṁ yathāpaṇihitaṁ dhātuso paccavekkhati: ‘atthi imasmiṁ kāye pathavīdhātu āpodhātu tejodhātu vāyodhātū’ti.*

Monks! Furthermore, a monk regards his body as a collection of elements-'In this body of mine, there is the earth element or solidity, water element or liquidity, fire element or temperature, air element or movement'

*Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, dakkho goghātako vā goghātakantevāsī vā gāviṁ vadhitvā catumahāpathe bilaso vibhajitvā nisinno assa; *

It is as if a skilled butcher or his assistant, having butchered a cow and cut it into pieces, sits at the crossroads. 

*evameva kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu imameva kāyaṁ yathāṭhitaṁ yathāpaṇihitaṁ dhātuso paccavekkhati: ‘atthi imasmiṁ kāye pathavīdhātu āpodhātu tejodhātu vāyodhātū’ti. *

In this way a monk regards his body as a collection of elements-'In this body of mine, there is the earth element or solidity, water element or liquidity, fire element or temperature, air element or movement'

*Tassa evaṁ appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato ye gehasitā sarasaṅkappā te pahīyanti. Tesaṁ pahānā ajjhattameva cittaṁ santiṭṭhati sannisīdati ekodi hoti samādhiyati. Evampi, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kāyagatāsatiṁ bhāveti.*

In this way, as they live diligently, continuously striving and determined, they eliminate thoughts about life in a family. As they abandon thoughts about life in a family, their mind remains still, settles down, becomes one, and is calmed. This is also how mindfulness of the body(*kāyagatāsati*) is developed. 

*Puna caparaṁ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu seyyathāpi passeyya sarīraṁ sivathikāya chaḍḍitaṁ ekāhamataṁ vā dvīhamataṁ vā tīhamataṁ vā uddhumātakaṁ vinīlakaṁ vipubbakajātaṁ. *

Furthermore, let's say a monk were to see a corpse abandoned in the burial ground, dead for one, two or three days, bloated, discoloured and decomposing. 

*So imameva kāyaṁ upasaṁharati: ‘ayampi kho kāyo evaṁdhammo evaṁbhāvī evaṁanatīto’ti. *

He would compare with his own body - 'My body is also of the same nature, destined for this, not exempt from this' 

*Tassa evaṁ appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato ye gehasitā sarasaṅkappā te pahīyanti. Tesaṁ pahānā ajjhattameva cittaṁ santiṭṭhati sannisīdati ekodi hoti samādhiyati. Evampi, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kāyagatāsatiṁ bhāveti.*

In this way, as they live diligently, continuously striving and determined, they eliminate thoughts about life in a family. As they abandon thoughts about life in a family, their mind remains still, settles down, becomes one, and is calmed. This is also how mindfulness of the body(*kāyagatāsati*) is developed. 

*Puna caparaṁ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu seyyathāpi passeyya sarīraṁ sivathikāya chaḍḍitaṁ kākehi vā khajjamānaṁ kulalehi vā khajjamānaṁ gijjhehi vā khajjamānaṁ kaṅkehi vā khajjamānaṁ sunakhehi vā khajjamānaṁ byagghehi vā khajjamānaṁ dīpīhi vā khajjamānaṁ siṅgālehi vā khajjamānaṁ vividhehi vā pāṇakajātehi khajjamānaṁ. *

Furthermore, let's say a monk were to see a corpse abandoned in the burial ground, being devoured by a crow, hawk, vulture, heron, dog, tiger, leopard, jackal and various types of worms or insects. 

*So imameva kāyaṁ upasaṁharati: ‘ayampi kho kāyo evaṁdhammo evaṁbhāvī evaṁanatīto’ti. *

He would compare with his own body - 'My body is also of the same nature, destined for this, not exempt from this' 

*Tassa evaṁ appamattassa …pe… evampi, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kāyagatāsatiṁ bhāveti.*

In this way, as they live diligently, continuously striving and determined, they eliminate thoughts about life in a family. As they abandon thoughts about life in a family, their mind remains still, settles down, becomes one, and is calmed. This is also how mindfulness of the body(*kāyagatāsati*) is developed. 

*Puna caparaṁ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu seyyathāpi passeyya sarīraṁ sivathikāya chaḍḍitaṁ aṭṭhikasaṅkhalikaṁ samaṁsalohitaṁ nhārusambandhaṁ …pe… aṭṭhikasaṅkhalikaṁ nimmaṁsalohitamakkhitaṁ nhārusambandhaṁ …pe… aṭṭhikasaṅkhalikaṁ apagatamaṁsalohitaṁ nhārusambandhaṁ …pe… aṭṭhikāni apagatasambandhāni disāvidisāvikkhittāni aññena hatthaṭṭhikaṁ aññena pādaṭṭhikaṁ aññena gopphakaṭṭhikaṁ aññena jaṅghaṭṭhikaṁ aññena ūruṭṭhikaṁ aññena kaṭiṭṭhikaṁ aññena phāsukaṭṭhikaṁ aññena piṭṭhiṭṭhikaṁ aññena khandhaṭṭhikaṁ aññena gīvaṭṭhikaṁ aññena hanukaṭṭhikaṁ aññena dantaṭṭhikaṁ aññena sīsakaṭāhaṁ. *

Furthermore, let's say a monk were to see a corpse abandoned in the burial ground, 
a skeleton with flesh and blood and connected by tendons, without flesh but bloodstained and connected by tendons, a skeleton without flesh and blood connected by tendons, bones disconnected and scattered in all directions- a hand bone on one side, a leg bone on another, ankle bone, shin bone, thigh bone, hip bone, rib bone, spinal column, upper backbone, neck bone, jaw bone, teeth, skull all scattered in different directions.     

*So imameva kāyaṁ upasaṁharati: ‘ayampi kho kāyo evaṁdhammo evaṁbhāvī evaṁanatīto’ti.*

He would compare with his own body - 'My body is also of the same nature, destined for this, not exempt from this' 

*Tassa evaṁ appamattassa …pe… evampi, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kāyagatāsatiṁ bhāveti.*

In this way, as they live diligently, continuously striving and determined, they eliminate thoughts about life in a family. As they abandon thoughts about life in a family, their mind remains still, settles down, becomes one, and is calmed. This is also how mindfulness of the body(*kāyagatāsati*) is developed. 

*Puna caparaṁ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu seyyathāpi passeyya sarīraṁ sivathikāya chaḍḍitaṁ— aṭṭhikāni setāni saṅkhavaṇṇapaṭibhāgāni …pe… aṭṭhikāni puñjakitāni terovassikāni …pe… aṭṭhikāni pūtīni cuṇṇakajātāni. *

Furthermore, let's say a monk were to see a corpse abandoned in the burial ground, bones white and shell coloured, bones heaped in a pile, bones more than a year old, bones rotten, crumbling to dust. 

*So imameva kāyaṁ upasaṁharati: ‘ayampi kho kāyo evaṁdhammo evaṁbhāvī evaṁanatīto’ti.*

He would compare with his own body - 'My body is also of the same nature, destined for this, not exempt from this' 

*Tassa evaṁ appamattassa … pe… evampi, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kāyagatāsatiṁ bhāveti.*

In this way, as they live diligently, continuously striving and determined, they eliminate thoughts about life in a family. As they abandon thoughts about life in a family, their mind remains still, settles down, becomes one, and is calmed. This is also how mindfulness of the body(*kāyagatāsati*) is developed. 

*Puna caparaṁ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vivicceva kāmehi, vivicca akusalehi dhammehi savitakkaṃ savicāraṃ vivekajaṃ pītisukhaṃ paṭhamaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati.

Furthermore, a monk secluded from sensual and unskillful mental states, while placing and directing the mind, with joy and bliss born from seclusion, he reaches the first jhana and dwells in it.  

*So imameva kāyaṁ vivekajena pītisukhena abhisandeti parisandeti paripūreti parippharati, nāssa kiñci sabbāvato kāyassa vivekajena pītisukhena apphuṭaṁ hoti. 

*Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, dakkho nhāpako vā nhāpakantevāsī vā kaṁsathāle nhānīyacuṇṇāni ākiritvā udakena paripphosakaṁ paripphosakaṁ sanneyya, sāyaṁ nhānīyapiṇḍi snehānugatā snehaparetā santarabāhirā phuṭā snehena na ca pagghariṇī; *

*evameva kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu imameva kāyaṁ vivekajena pītisukhena abhisandeti parisandeti paripūreti parippharati; nāssa kiñci sabbāvato kāyassa vivekajena pītisukhena apphuṭaṁ hoti. *

*Tassa evaṁ appamattassa … pe… evampi, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kāyagatāsatiṁ bhāveti.*

*Puna caparaṁ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu vitakkavicārānaṃ vūpasamā ajjhattaṃ sampasādanaṃ cetaso ekodibhāvaṃ avitakkaṃ avicāraṃ samādhijaṃ pītisukhaṃ dutiyaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati.*

Furthermore, a monk with the placing and directing the mind subsided, the mind settles down inwardly, unifying without placing and directing the mind, with joy and bliss born of the stillness of the mind, he reaches the second jhana and dwells in it.

*So imameva kāyaṁ samādhijena pītisukhena abhisandeti parisandeti paripūreti parippharati; nāssa kiñci sabbāvato kāyassa samādhijena pītisukhena apphuṭaṁ hoti. *

*Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, udakarahado gambhīro ubbhidodako. Tassa nevassa puratthimāya disāya udakassa āyamukhaṁ na pacchimāya disāya udakassa āyamukhaṁ na uttarāya disāya udakassa āyamukhaṁ na dakkhiṇāya disāya udakassa āyamukhaṁ; devo ca na kālena kālaṁ sammā dhāraṁ anuppaveccheyya; 

*atha kho tamhāva udakarahadā sītā vāridhārā ubbhijjitvā tameva udakarahadaṁ sītena vārinā abhisandeyya parisandeyya paripūreyya paripphareyya, nāssa kiñci sabbāvato udakarahadassa sītena vārinā apphuṭaṁ assa; *

*evameva kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu imameva kāyaṁ samādhijena pītisukhena abhisandeti parisandeti paripūreti parippharati, nāssa kiñci sabbāvato kāyassa samādhijena pītisukhena apphuṭaṁ hoti. *

*Tassa evaṁ appamattassa …pe… evampi, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kāyagatāsatiṁ bhāveti.*

*Puna caparaṁ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu pītiyā ca virāgā upekkhako ca viharati sato sampajāno, sukhañca kāyena paṭisaṃvedeti, yaṃ taṃ ariyā ācikkhanti – ‘upekkhako satimā sukhavihārī’ti, tatiyaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati.*

Furthermore, a monk with the fading of desire for joy becomes an equanimous observer, mindful and clearly comprehending(only possible due to equanimity or non-reactivity), experiences bliss in the body. It is what the noble ones proclaim: 'A mindful equanimous observer lives in bliss'. He reaches the third jhana and dwells in it. 

>Sato sampajāno is a composite word used in multiple contexts to describe a state of clear comprehension, which is only possible with continuous mindfulness and non-reactivity of the mind. In other words, sampajāno is seeing without the distortions of reaction. Hence, sampajāno implies both sati and upekkha to be present. This is a subtle version of the situational awareness that the word describes at the beginning of *kayagatasati*.

*So imameva kāyaṁ nippītikena sukhena abhisandeti parisandeti paripūreti parippharati, nāssa kiñci sabbāvato kāyassa nippītikena sukhena apphuṭaṁ hoti.*

This body drenches, soaks, fills up with bliss, devoid of joy. There is no part of the body that is not filled with bliss, devoid of joy. 

*Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, uppaliniyaṁ vā paduminiyaṁ vā puṇḍarīkiniyaṁ vā appekaccāni uppalāni vā padumāni vā puṇḍarīkāni vā udake jātāni udake saṁvaḍḍhāni udakānuggatāni antonimuggaposīni, tāni yāva caggā yāva ca mūlā sītena vārinā abhisannāni parisannāni paripūrāni paripphuṭāni, nāssa kiñci sabbāvataṁ uppalānaṁ vā padumānaṁ vā puṇḍarīkānaṁ vā sītena vārinā apphuṭaṁ assa; *

*evameva kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu imameva kāyaṁ nippītikena sukhena abhisandeti parisandeti paripūreti parippharati, nāssa kiñci sabbāvato kāyassa nippītikena sukhena apphuṭaṁ hoti. *

*Tassa evaṁ appamattassa …pe… evampi, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kāyagatāsatiṁ bhāveti.*

*Puna caparaṁ, bhikkhave, bhikkhu sukhassa ca pahānā dukkhassa ca pahānā, pubbeva somanassadomanassānaṃ atthaṅgamā adukkhamasukhaṃ upekkhāsatipārisuddhiṃ catutthaṃ jhānaṃ upasampajja viharati. *

*So imameva kāyaṁ parisuddhena cetasā pariyodātena pharitvā nisinno hoti; nāssa kiñci sabbāvato kāyassa parisuddhena cetasā pariyodātena apphuṭaṁ hoti. *

*Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, puriso odātena vatthena sasīsaṁ pārupitvā nisinno assa, nāssa kiñci sabbāvato kāyassa odātena vatthena apphuṭaṁ assa; 

*evameva kho, bhikkhave, bhikkhu imameva kāyaṁ parisuddhena cetasā pariyodātena pharitvā nisinno hoti, nāssa kiñci sabbāvato kāyassa parisuddhena cetasā pariyodātena apphuṭaṁ hoti. *

*Tassa evaṁ appamattassa ātāpino pahitattassa viharato ye gehasitā sarasaṅkappā te pahīyanti. *

*Tesaṁ pahānā ajjhattameva cittaṁ santiṭṭhati, sannisīdati ekodi hoti samādhiyati. Evampi, bhikkhave, bhikkhu kāyagatāsatiṁ bhāveti.*

*Yassa kassaci, bhikkhave, kāyagatāsati bhāvitā bahulīkatā, antogadhāvāssa kusalā dhammā ye keci vijjābhāgiyā. *

*Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, yassa kassaci mahāsamuddo cetasā phuṭo, antogadhāvāssa kunnadiyo yā kāci samuddaṅgamā; *

*evameva kho, bhikkhave, yassa kassaci kāyagatāsati bhāvitā bahulīkatā, antogadhāvāssa kusalā dhammā ye keci vijjābhāgiyā.*

*Yassa kassaci, bhikkhave, kāyagatāsati abhāvitā abahulīkatā, labhati tassa māro otāraṁ, labhati tassa māro ārammaṇaṁ. *

*Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, puriso garukaṁ silāguḷaṁ allamattikāpuñje pakkhipeyya.*

*Taṁ kiṁ maññatha, bhikkhave, api nu taṁ garukaṁ silāguḷaṁ allamattikāpuñje labhetha otāran”ti?*

*“Evaṁ, bhante”.*

*“Evameva kho, bhikkhave, yassa kassaci kāyagatāsati abhāvitā abahulīkatā, labhati tassa māro otāraṁ, labhati tassa māro ārammaṇaṁ.*

*Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, sukkhaṁ kaṭṭhaṁ koḷāpaṁ; atha puriso āgaccheyya uttarāraṇiṁ ādāya: ‘aggiṁ abhinibbattessāmi, tejo pātukarissāmī’ti.*

*Taṁ kiṁ maññatha, bhikkhave, api nu so puriso amuṁ sukkhaṁ kaṭṭhaṁ koḷāpaṁ uttarāraṇiṁ ādāya abhimanthento aggiṁ abhinibbatteyya, tejo pātukareyyā”ti? *
