Saṁyutta Nikāya 35.247

*“Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, puriso arugatto pakkagatto saravanaṁ paviseyya. Tassa kusakaṇṭakā ceva pāde vijjheyyuṁ, sarapattāni ca gattāni vilekheyyuṁ. Variant: sarapattāni ca gattāni → sarapattāni pakkagattāni (sya-all, km); arupakkāni gattāni (pts1ed, mr) Evañhi so, bhikkhave, puriso bhiyyoso mattāya tatonidānaṁ dukkhaṁ domanassaṁ paṭisaṁvediyetha.*

Bhikkhus, let us say a person were to enter a thicket of reeds with wounded and festering limbs, the sharp blades of the grass would pierce and bruise the wounds. This person will experience further pain and distress due to this. 

*Evameva kho, bhikkhave, idhekacco bhikkhu gāmagato vā araññagato vā labhati vattāraṁ: ‘ayañca so āyasmā evaṅkārī evaṁsamācāro asucigāmakaṇṭako’ti. ayaṁ so (?) Taṁ kaṇṭakoti iti viditvā saṁvaro ca asaṁvaro ca veditabbo.*

In the same way, a bhikkhu goes to a village or a wilderness and faces criticism like this, 'This venerable, acting like this, behaving like this, is an impure thorn to the village.' The one who receives such criticism should understand (sense) restraint and lack of (sense) restraint.

*Kathañca, bhikkhave, asaṁvaro hoti?*

Furthermore, how is someone unrestrained (in their senses)?

*Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu cakkhunā rūpaṁ disvā piyarūpe rūpe adhimuccati, appiyarūpe rūpe byāpajjati, anupaṭṭhitakāyassati ca viharati parittacetaso. Tañca cetovimuttiṁ paññāvimuttiṁ yathābhūtaṁ nappajānāti, yatthassa te uppannā pāpakā akusalā dhammā aparisesā nirujjhanti.*

Bhikkhus! A Bhikkhu, when he sees a sight through the eyes, if it is pleasant, he is drawn towards it; if it is unpleasant, he is repelled by it. He lives with his mindfulness of body not established and a limited, small, constricted mind. Such a bhikkhu does not know liberation by mind and wisdom by witnessing as it is; such a state leads to the complete eradication of the arisen sinful and unwholesome states without any remainder.  

*Sotena saddaṁ sutvā …*

*manasā dhammaṁ viññāya piyarūpe dhamme adhimuccati, appiyarūpe dhamme byāpajjati, anupaṭṭhitakāyassati ca viharati parittacetaso, tañca cetovimuttiṁ paññāvimuttiṁ yathābhūtaṁ nappajānāti, yatthassa te uppannā pāpakā akusalā dhammā aparisesā nirujjhanti.*

*Seyyathāpi, bhikkhave, puriso chappāṇake gahetvā nānāvisaye nānāgocare daḷhāya rajjuyā bandheyya. Ahiṁ gahetvā daḷhāya rajjuyā bandheyya. Susumāraṁ gahetvā daḷhāya rajjuyā bandheyya.

It is as if a person were to catch six different animals with different habitats and feeding grounds, and tie them together with a strong rope, knotting them in the middle. A snake, a crocodile, a bird, a dog, a jackal, and a monkey are caught and tied together with a strong rope, knotting them in the middle. 

*Atha kho, te, bhikkhave, chappāṇakā nānāvisayā nānāgocarā sakaṁ sakaṁ gocaravisayaṁ āviñcheyyuṁ— ahi āviñcheyya ‘vammikaṁ pavekkhāmī’ti, susumāro āviñcheyya ‘udakaṁ pavekkhāmī’ti, pakkhī āviñcheyya ‘ākāsaṁ ḍessāmī’ti, kukkuro āviñcheyya ‘gāmaṁ pavekkhāmī’ti, siṅgālo āviñcheyya ‘sīvathikaṁ pavekkhāmī’ti, makkaṭo āviñcheyya ‘vanaṁ pavekkhāmī’ti. Yadā kho te, bhikkhave, chappāṇakā jhattā assu kilantā, atha kho yo nesaṁ pāṇakānaṁ balavataro assa tassa te anuvatteyyuṁ, anuvidhāyeyyuṁ vasaṁ gaccheyyuṁ.* 

The six animals, which come from different habitats and feeding grounds, attempt to return to their respective habitats. The snake pulls, saying, 'I shall go to the ant hill. 'The crocodile pulls, saying, 'I shall go to the water. 'The bird pulls, saying, 'I shall fly in the sky'. The dog pulls, saying, 'I shall go to the village'. The hyena pulls, saying, 'I shall go to the charnel ground'. The monkey pulls, saying, 'I shall go to the forest'. By doing so, all six animals get worn out. The strongest animal will prevail, and the rest of the animals have to submit to it. 

*Evameva kho, bhikkhave, yassa kassaci bhikkhuno kāyagatāsati abhāvitā abahulīkatā, taṁ cakkhu āviñchati manāpiyesu rūpesu, amanāpiyā rūpā paṭikūlā honti …pe… mano āviñchati manāpiyesu dhammesu, amanāpiyā dhammā paṭikūlā honti.*

Bhikkhus, A Bhikkhu whose mindfulness of returning to the body is not established and not repeated again and again. For him, the eye draws him towards a pleasant sight and repels him from an unpleasant one; the ear..., the mind draws him towards a pleasant flash of memory and repels him from an unpleasant one. 

*Evaṁ kho, bhikkhave, asaṁvaro hoti.*

Bhikkhus, this is a Lack of (sense) restraint. 

*Kathañca, bhikkhave, saṁvaro hoti?*

Bhikkhus, what is (sense) restraint? 

*Idha, bhikkhave, bhikkhu cakkhunā rūpaṁ disvā piyarūpe rūpe nādhimuccati, appiyarūpe rūpe na byāpajjati, upaṭṭhitakāyassati ca viharati appamāṇacetaso, tañca cetovimuttiṁ paññāvimuttiṁ yathābhūtaṁ pajānāti, yatthassa te uppannā pāpakā akusalā dhammā aparisesā nirujjhanti …pe…*

Bhikkhus! A Bhikkhu, when he sees a sight through the eyes, if it is pleasant, he is not drawn towards it; if it is unpleasant, he is not repelled by it. He lives with his mindfulness of body established and a boundless mind. Such a bhikkhu knows liberation by mind and wisdom by witnessing as it is; such a state leads to the complete eradication of the arisen sinful and unwholesome states without any remainder.  

*jivhāya rasaṁ sāyitvā …pe… manasā dhammaṁ viññāya piyarūpe dhamme nādhimuccati, appiyarūpe dhamme na byāpajjati, upaṭṭhitakāyassati ca viharati appamāṇacetaso, tañca cetovimuttiṁ paññāvimuttiṁ yathābhūtaṁ pajānāti yatthassa te uppannā pāpakā akusalā dhammā aparisesā nirujjhanti.*

It is as if a person were to catch six different animals with different habitats and feeding grounds, and tie them with a strong rope. A snake, a crocodile, a bird, a dog, a jackal, and a monkey are caught and tied with a strong rope. The strong rope is then tied to a strong post or pillar.

*Atha kho te, bhikkhave, chappāṇakā nānāvisayā nānāgocarā sakaṁ sakaṁ gocaravisayaṁ āviñcheyyuṁ— ahi āviñcheyya ‘vammikaṁ pavekkhāmī’ti, susumāro āviñcheyya ‘udakaṁ pavekkhāmī’ti, pakkhī āviñcheyya ‘ākāsaṁ ḍessāmī’ti, kukkuro āviñcheyya ‘gāmaṁ pavekkhāmī’ti, siṅgālo āviñcheyya ‘sīvathikaṁ pavekkhāmī’ti, makkaṭo āviñcheyya ‘vanaṁ pavekkhāmī’ti. Yadā kho te, bhikkhave, chappāṇakā jhattā assu kilantā, atha tameva khīlaṁ vā thambhaṁ vā upatiṭṭheyyuṁ, upanisīdeyyuṁ, upanipajjeyyuṁ.*

*Evameva kho, bhikkhave, yassa kassaci bhikkhuno kāyagatāsati bhāvitā bahulīkatā, taṁ cakkhu nāviñchati manāpiyesu rūpesu, amanāpiyā rūpā nappaṭikūlā honti …pe… jivhā nāviñchati manāpiyesu rasesu …pe… mano nāviñchati manāpiyesu dhammesu, amanāpiyā dhammā nappaṭikūlā honti. Evaṁ kho, bhikkhave, saṁvaro hoti.*

Bhikkhus, A Bhikkhu whose mindfulness of returning to the body is established and repeated again and again, for him, the eye draws him towards a pleasant sight and repels him from an unpleasant one; the ear..., the mind draws him towards a pleasant flash of memory and repels him from an unpleasant one. 

*‘Daḷhe khīle vā thambhe vā’ti kho, bhikkhave, kāyagatāya satiyā etaṁ adhivacanaṁ.*

Bhikkhus, 'A strong post or pillar' is the apt epithet for Kayagatasati, mindfulness that returns to the body. 

*Tasmātiha vo, bhikkhave, evaṁ sikkhitabbaṁ: ‘kāyagatā no sati bhāvitā bhavissati bahulīkatā yānīkatā vatthukatā anuṭṭhitā paricitā susamāraddhā’ti. Evañhi kho, bhikkhave, sikkhitabban”ti.*

Therefore, Bhikkhus, this should be the way of training: 'The mindfulness to return to the body when developed, repeated again and again, made to be a vehicle, made as a foundation, repeatedly practised, strengthened and resolutely undertaken will be established'. 

This is how the training has to be undertaken.
