This is a state of mind characterised by complete awareness, where there is a high level of watchfulness and a weak or non-existent ego. In this state of mind, the mind does not grasp any objects that come up on the mind's screen and consider them as mine. It can watch or witness whatever is coming up on the mind's screen without being pulled into the whirlpool of emotions.  
### ayonisomanasikāra
Its opposite is ***ayonisomanasikāra***, which is characterised by a limited or sporadic awareness and a strong ego. It is when the mind has missed witnessing the beginning of whatever appears on the mind's screen and gets pulled into the whirlpool of emotions. It is now part of the play, not a witness to it, and mistakenly identifies the contents of the play to be the I. The longer the mind is a part of the play, the stronger the ego becomes, and the more this cycle is repeated, the stronger the ***saṅkhāra***  —the automatic habit pattern that kicks in when you are not aware —becomes. 

For a beginner, ayonisomanasikāra may be the predominant state of mind, and moving from *ayonisomanasikāra* to *yonisomanasikāra* is the crux of the *sikkapada* —the path of training. For a beginner, yonisomanasikāra is to be watchful of the current state of mind, whatever it may be. If the mind is pulled into the whirlpool of emotions, being aware of that fact is the first step in emerging from it, and being aware of it sooner rather than later is crucial. This is a gradual process where the amount of time you are aware of your own mind's state is gradually increased.
