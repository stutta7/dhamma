It is like this, monks. When the rain god showers a droplet of rain on the top of a mountain, the water rolling forward forms a brook. This brook forms a small pool of water. The small pool of water becomes a large pool of water, which becomes a rivulet. The rivulet turns into a great river, the great river becomes a great sea, which further turns into the ocean. Thus, the small droplet on top of the mountain feeds the ocean and fulfils it.

A sight of a person whom you do not like, when you are aware that the mind has registered the sight and its reaction, then the reaction will not multiply due to the awareness of it. The most active sense door is the mind, and it will continuously trigger visual, auditory, taste, smell or sensation from the past.
