# Mahācattārīsakasutta
Majjhima Nikāya 117

*Evaṁ me sutaṁ— ekaṁ samayaṁ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṁ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi: “bhikkhavo”ti.*

Thus I heard: At a time when the Bhagavā was residing at Jetavana, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery near Sāvatthī. The Bhagava invited the bhikkhus, addressing them as "Bhikkhus."

*“Bhadante” ti te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṁ. Bhagavā etadavoca:*

The Bhikkhus responded with "Yes, Sir". The Bhagava spoke thus: 

*“ariyaṁ vo, bhikkhave, sammāsamādhiṁ desessāmi saupanisaṁ saparikkhāraṁ. Taṁ suṇātha, sādhukaṁ manasi karotha, bhāsissāmī”ti.*

Bhikkhus, I will teach you the supporting conditions and requisites for the Noble Right Samadhi, stillness. All of you, pay careful attention, I shall speak. 

*“Evaṁ, bhante”ti kho te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṁ. Bhagavā etadavoca:*

The Bhikkhus replied, "Yes, Sir". The Bhagava spoke thus: 

*“Katamo ca, bhikkhave, ariyo sammāsamādhi saupaniso saparikkhāro? *

What are the supporting conditions and the requisites for the Noble Right Samadhi? 

*Seyyathidaṁ—sammādiṭṭhi, sammāsaṅkappo, sammāvācā, sammākammanto, sammāājīvo, sammāvāyāmo, sammāsati; *

They are: right view, right volition, right speech, right action, correct way of life, right effort, right awareness.

*yā kho, bhikkhave, imehi sattahaṅgehi cittassa ekaggatā parikkhatā— ayaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, ariyo sammāsamādhi saupaniso itipi, saparikkhāro itipi.*

With these seven factors, the mind is endowed with unification; this is what I call supporting conditions and the requisites for the noble right samadhi.

*Tatra, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti. Kathañca, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti? *

In this regard, right view comes first. Why does the right view come first? 

*Micchādiṭṭhiṁ ‘micchādiṭṭhī’ti pajānāti, sammādiṭṭhiṁ ‘sammādiṭṭhī’ti pajānāti—sāssa hoti sammādiṭṭhi.*

When one knows wrong view as 'wrong view' and right view as 'right view', then one has the Right view. 

*Katamā ca, bhikkhave, micchādiṭṭhi? *

What is the wrong view? 

*‘Natthi dinnaṁ, natthi yiṭṭhaṁ, natthi hutaṁ, natthi sukatadukkaṭānaṁ kammānaṁ phalaṁ vipāko, natthi ayaṁ loko, natthi paro loko, natthi mātā, natthi pitā, natthi sattā opapātikā, natthi loke samaṇabrāhmaṇā sammaggatā sammāpaṭipannā ye imañca lokaṁ parañca lokaṁ sayaṁ abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedentī’ti— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, micchādiṭṭhi.*

There is no value in giving or offering. Wholesome and unwholesome actions have no consequence; there is neither this world nor the other. There are no duties towards mother or father; life is not spontaneously reborn. There are no ascetics or brahmins who, by walking the right way and practising correctly, declare about this world and the other through their direct knowledge acquired from the personal experience of the truth.

*Katamā ca, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi? *

What is the right view? 

*Sammādiṭṭhimpahaṁ, bhikkhave, dvāyaṁ vadāmi— atthi, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi sāsavā puññabhāgiyā upadhivepakkā; atthi, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi ariyā anāsavā lokuttarā maggaṅgā.*

Right view can be in two ways. There is the Right View that is tainted by defilements, which leads to diminishing the merits of good deeds and results in attachment. In contrast, the other Right View, which is noble and free from defilements, takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path.

*Katamā ca, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi sāsavā puññabhāgiyā upadhivepakkā? *

What is the Right View that is tainted by defilements, which leads to diminishing the merits of good deeds and results in attachment?

*‘Atthi dinnaṁ, atthi yiṭṭhaṁ, atthi hutaṁ, atthi sukatadukkaṭānaṁ kammānaṁ phalaṁ vipāko, atthi ayaṁ loko, atthi paro loko, atthi mātā, atthi pitā, atthi sattā opapātikā, atthi loke samaṇabrāhmaṇā sammaggatā sammāpaṭipannā ye imañca lokaṁ parañca lokaṁ sayaṁ abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedentī’ti— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi sāsavā puññabhāgiyā upadhivepakkā.*

There is value in giving or offering. Wholesome and unwholesome actions have consequences; there is this world and the other. There are no duties toward mother and father; life is spontaneously reborn. There are ascetics or brahmins who, by walking the right way and practising correctly, declare about this world and the other through their direct knowledge acquired from the personal experience of the truth.

*Katamā ca, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi ariyā anāsavā lokuttarā maggaṅgā? *

What is the Right View, which is noble and free from defilements, takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path?

*Yā kho, bhikkhave, ariyacittassa anāsavacittassa ariyamaggasamaṅgino ariyamaggaṁ bhāvayato paññā paññindriyaṁ paññābalaṁ dhammavicayasambojjhaṅgo sammādiṭṭhi maggaṅgaṁ— ayaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi ariyā anāsavā lokuttarā maggaṅgā.*

It is Wisdom -faculty of wisdom, power of wisdom, awakening factor of investigation of the truth- that I call the Right View- which is noble, free from defilements, takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path- (for someone who aspires) for a noble mind, free from defilements, endowed with the noble path, for development in the noble path.

>All insights that one gets through direct experience of the truth constitute the noble Right View. 

*So micchādiṭṭhiyā pahānāya vāyamati, sammādiṭṭhiyā, upasampadāya, svāssa hoti sammāvāyāmo. *

He puts effort into abandoning the wrong view and cultivating the Right View, which for him is the right effort. 

*So sato micchādiṭṭhiṁ pajahati, sato sammādiṭṭhiṁ upasampajja viharati, sāssa hoti sammāsati. *

He mindfully abandons wrong view, develops right view, which for him is the Right Awareness.

*Itiyime tayo dhammā sammādiṭṭhiṁ anuparidhāvanti anuparivattanti, seyyathidaṁ—sammādiṭṭhi, sammāvāyāmo, sammāsati.*

These three things keep going around Right View: they are Right View, Right Effort, and Right Awareness.

*Tatra, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti. Kathañca, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti? *

In this regard, Right View comes first. Why does the right view come first? 

*Micchāsaṅkappaṁ ‘micchāsaṅkappo’ti pajānāti, sammāsaṅkappaṁ ‘sammāsaṅkappo’ti pajānāti, sāssa hoti sammādiṭṭhi.*

When one recognises wrong volition as 'wrong volition' and right volition as 'right volition', then one possesses the Right volition. 

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, micchāsaṅkappo? *

What is the wrong volition?

*Kāmasaṅkappo, byāpādasaṅkappo, vihiṁsāsaṅkappo— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, micchāsaṅkappo.*

These are wrong volitions - volition towards sensual desires, ill will and causing harm.

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, sammāsaṅkappo? *

What is the right volition? 

*Sammāsaṅkappampahaṁ, bhikkhave, dvāyaṁ vadāmi— atthi, bhikkhave, sammāsaṅkappo sāsavo puññabhāgiyo upadhivepakko; atthi, bhikkhave, sammāsaṅkappo ariyo anāsavo lokuttaro maggaṅgo.*

Right volition can be in two ways. There is the Right volition that is tainted by defilements, which leads to diminishing the merits of good deeds and results in attachment. In contrast, the other Right volition, which is noble and free from defilements, takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path.

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, sammāsaṅkappo sāsavo puññabhāgiyo upadhivepakko? *

What is the Right volition that is tainted by defilements, which leads to diminishing the merits of good deeds and results in attachment?

*Nekkhammasaṅkappo, abyāpādasaṅkappo, avihiṁsāsaṅkappo: ‘ayaṁ, bhikkhave, sammāsaṅkappo sāsavo puññabhāgiyo upadhivepakko’.*

The volition to renunciate, generate no mental ill-will, and cause no harm. This is the Right volition that is tainted by defilements, which leads to diminishing the merits of good deeds and results in attachment.

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, sammāsaṅkappo ariyo anāsavo lokuttaro maggaṅgo? *

What is the Right volition, which is noble and free from defilements, that takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path?

*Yo kho, bhikkhave, ariyacittassa anāsavacittassa ariyamaggasamaṅgino ariyamaggaṁ bhāvayato takko vitakko saṅkappo appanā byappanā cetaso abhiniropanā vacīsaṅkhāro— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, sammāsaṅkappo ariyo anāsavo lokuttaro maggaṅgo.*

It is the focusing, fixing down the mind on the beginning of the internal dialogue -thoughts, volitions - that I call the Right Volition- which is noble, free from defilements, takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path- (for someone who aspires) for a noble mind, free from defilements, endowed with the noble path, for development in the noble path.

>Fixing your mind on recognising when the internal silence ends and the internal dialogue begins. If you miss the start, acknowledge that the internal dialogue has begun and identify which hindrance, *nīvarana*, is active at that moment. If ill will has started, recognise that it has begun. If desire has started, recognise that desire has initiated. Determine which sense-door is influencing your mind.

*So micchāsaṅkappassa pahānāya vāyamati, sammāsaṅkappassa upasampadāya, svāssa hoti sammāvāyāmo. So sato micchāsaṅkappaṁ pajahati, sato sammāsaṅkappaṁ upasampajja viharati; sāssa hoti sammāsati. Itiyime tayo dhammā sammāsaṅkappaṁ anuparidhāvanti anuparivattanti, seyyathidaṁ—sammādiṭṭhi, sammāvāyāmo, sammāsati.

He puts effort into abandoning the wrong Volition and cultivating the Right Volition, which for him is the right effort. He mindfully abandons wrong Volition, develops right Volition, which for him is the Right Awareness. These three things keep going around the Right Volition: they are Right View, Right Effort, and Right Awareness.

*Tatra, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti. Kathañca, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti?*

In this regard, Right View comes first. Why does the right view come first? 

*Micchāvācaṁ ‘micchāvācā’ti pajānāti, sammāvācaṁ ‘sammāvācā’ti pajānāti; sāssa hoti sammādiṭṭhi. Katamā ca, bhikkhave, micchāvācā?*

When one knows wrong speech as 'wrong speech' and right speech as 'right speech', then one has the Right speech.  What is wrong speech? 

*Musāvādo, pisuṇā vācā, pharusā vācā, samphappalāpo— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, micchāvācā.*

Lies, divisive speech, speech filled with hatred, gossip or useless talk. 

*Katamā ca, bhikkhave, sammāvācā?*

What is right speech? 

*Sammāvācampahaṁ, bhikkhave, dvāyaṁ vadāmi— atthi, bhikkhave, sammāvācā sāsavā puññabhāgiyā upadhivepakkā; atthi, bhikkhave, sammāvācā ariyā anāsavā lokuttarā maggaṅgā.*

Right speech is of two ways. There is a Right Speech that is tainted by defilements, which leads to diminishing the merits of good deeds and results in attachment. In contrast, the other Right Speech, which is noble and free from defilements, takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path.

*Katamā ca, bhikkhave, sammāvācā sāsavā puññabhāgiyā upadhivepakkā?*

What is the Right Speech that is tainted by defilements, which leads to diminishing the merits of good deeds and results in attachment?

*Musāvādā veramaṇī, pisuṇāya vācāya veramaṇī, pharusāya vācāya veramaṇī, samphappalāpā veramaṇī— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, sammāvācā sāsavā puññabhāgiyā upadhivepakkā.*

Abandoning lies, divisive speech, speech filled with hatred, gossip or useless talk. This is the Right Speech that is tainted by defilements, which leads to diminishing the merits of good deeds and results in attachment.

*Katamā ca, bhikkhave, sammāvācā ariyā anāsavā lokuttarā maggaṅgā? *

What is the Right Speech, which is noble and free from defilements, takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path?

*Yā kho, bhikkhave, ariyacittassa anāsavacittassa ariyamaggasamaṅgino ariyamaggaṁ bhāvayato catūhi vacīduccaritehi ārati virati paṭivirati veramaṇī— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, sammāvācā ariyā anāsavā lokuttarā maggaṅgā.*

It is refraining, giving up, abstaining from the four wrong speech that I call the Right Speech- which is noble, free from defilements, takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path- (for someone who aspires) for a noble mind, free from defilements, endowed with the noble path, for development in the noble path.

>Veramani is abandoning wrong speech through a process of gradually increasing awareness about the state of mind that leads one to commit one of the four wrong speeches. This awareness helps in recognising when verbal misconduct is about to happen and ultimately avoiding wrong speech altogether. This process occurs naturally as awareness increases and is not an act of will. 
>As this is not an act of will, it does not cause conflict in the mind and therefore no defilements. This is why it is considered a factor in the path. 

*So micchāvācāya pahānāya vāyamati, sammāvācāya upasampadāya; svāssa hoti sammāvāyāmo.*

He puts effort into abandoning the Wrong Speech and cultivating the Right Speech, which for him is the right effort.

*So sato micchāvācaṁ pajahati, sato sammāvācaṁ upasampajja viharati; sāssa hoti sammāsati.*

He mindfully abandons wrong Speech, develops right Speech, which for him is the Right Awareness.

*Itiyime tayo dhammā sammāvācaṁ anuparidhāvanti anuparivattanti, seyyathidaṁ—sammādiṭṭhi, sammāvāyāmo, sammāsati.*

These three things keep going around the Right Speech: they are Right View, Right Effort, and Right Awareness.

*Tatra, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti. Kathañca, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti? *

In this regard, Right View comes first. Why does the right view come first? 

*Micchākammantaṁ ‘micchākammanto’ti pajānāti, sammākammantaṁ ‘sammākammanto’ti pajānāti; sāssa hoti sammādiṭṭhi.*

When one knows wrong action as 'wrong action' and right action as 'right action', then one has the Right action.

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, micchākammanto?*

What is the wrong action? 

*Pāṇātipāto, adinnādānaṁ, kāmesumicchācāro— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, micchākammanto.*

Taking life, taking what is not given, misconduct concerning sensual desires. This is the wrong action.

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, sammākammanto?*

What is right action? 

*Sammākammantampahaṁ, bhikkhave, dvāyaṁ vadāmi— atthi, bhikkhave, sammākammanto sāsavo puññabhāgiyo upadhivepakko; atthi, bhikkhave, sammākammanto ariyo anāsavo lokuttaro maggaṅgo.*

Right action is in two ways. There is a Right action that is tainted by defilements, which leads to diminishing the merits of good deeds and results in attachment. In contrast, the other Right action, which is noble and free from defilements, takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path.

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, sammākammanto sāsavo puññabhāgiyo upadhivepakko?*

What is the Right Action that is tainted by defilements, which leads to diminishing the merits of good deeds and results in attachment?

*Pāṇātipātā veramaṇī, adinnādānā veramaṇī, kāmesumicchācārā veramaṇī— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, sammākammanto sāsavo puññabhāgiyo upadhivepakko.*

Abandoning taking life, abandoning taking what is not given, abandoning misconduct concerning sensual desires. This is the Right Action that is tainted by defilements, which diminishes the merits of good deeds and results in attachment.

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, sammākammanto ariyo anāsavo lokuttaro maggaṅgo?*

What is the Right action, which is noble and free from defilements, that takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path?

*Yā kho, bhikkhave, ariyacittassa anāsavacittassa ariyamaggasamaṅgino ariyamaggaṁ bhāvayato tīhi kāyaduccaritehi ārati virati paṭivirati veramaṇī— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, sammākammanto ariyo anāsavo lokuttaro maggaṅgo.*

It is refraining, giving up, abstaining from the four wrong Action that I call the Right Action- which is noble, free from defilements, takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path- (for someone who aspires) for a noble mind, free from defilements, endowed with the noble path, for development in the noble path.

>*veramaṇī* of wrong actions is complete abandonment of wrong actions, similar to right speech, through a process of increased self-awareness of the states of mind leading to wrong action. When a lie is spoken, the monk or trainee is aware immediately that what is said is a lie. The next step is to recognise that a lie is about to be spoken and ultimately completely abandon speaking lies.
> This process of increased self-awareness is built on top of awareness of the internal dialogue and understanding of how the mind is affected by the sense doors. The combination of the two gives the monk or trainee the necessary foundation to recognise an inclination to commit misconduct before it is committed and thereby avert the action.
> At this stage, it is a good practice to go to a teacher or a person respected by the monk or trainee and confess to making a mistake and promise restraint in this regard in future. 


*So micchākammantassa pahānāya vāyamati, sammākammantassa upasampadāya; svāssa hoti sammāvāyāmo.So sato micchākammantaṁ pajahati, sato sammākammantaṁ upasampajja viharati; sāssa hoti sammāsati. Itiyime tayo dhammā sammākammantaṁ anuparidhāvanti anuparivattanti, seyyathidaṁ—sammādiṭṭhi, sammāvāyāmo, sammāsati.*

He puts effort into abandoning the Wrong Action and cultivating the Right Action, which for him is the right effort. He mindfully abandons wrong Action, develops right Action, which for him is the Right Awareness. These three things, which revolve around Right Action, are Right View, Right Effort, and Right Awareness.

*Tatra, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti. Kathañca, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti? *

In this regard, Right View comes first. Why does the right view come first?

*Micchāājīvaṁ ‘micchāājīvo’ti pajānāti, sammāājīvaṁ ‘sammāājīvo’ti pajānāti; sāssa hoti sammādiṭṭhi.*

When one knows the wrong way of life as 'wrong way of life' and the right way of life as 'right way of life', then one has the right view.

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, micchāājīvo? *

What is the wrong way of life? 

*Kuhanā, lapanā, nemittikatā, nippesikatā, lābhena lābhaṁ nijigīsanatā— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, micchāājīvo.*

Cheating, flattering, hinting for gain, belittling, greedy for profit. This is the wrong way of life. 

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, sammāājīvo? *

What is the right way of life? 

*Sammāājīvampahaṁ, bhikkhave, dvāyaṁ vadāmi— atthi, bhikkhave, sammāājīvo sāsavo puññabhāgiyo upadhivepakko; atthi, bhikkhave, sammāājīvo ariyo anāsavo lokuttaro maggaṅgo.*

The right way of life is of two ways. There is a right way of life that is tainted by defilements, which diminishes the merits of good deeds and leads to attachment. In contrast, there is another right way of life, which is noble and free from defilements, taking you beyond the worlds and a factor of the path.

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, sammāājīvo sāsavo puññabhāgiyo upadhivepakko? *

What is the right way of life that is tainted by defilements, which diminishes the merits of good deeds and leads to attachment?

*Idha, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako micchāājīvaṁ pahāya sammāājīvena jīvikaṁ kappeti— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, sammāājīvo sāsavo puññabhāgiyo upadhivepakko.*

Monks, A noble disciple who abandons the wrong way of life and leads a life towards the right way of life is said to have the right way of life that is tainted by defilements, which diminishes the merits of good deeds and leads to attachment.

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, sammāājīvo ariyo anāsavo lokuttaro maggaṅgo? *

What is the right way of life, which is noble and free from defilements, that takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path?

*Yā kho, bhikkhave, ariyacittassa anāsavacittassa ariyamaggasamaṅgino ariyamaggaṁ bhāvayato micchāājīvā ārati virati paṭivirati veramaṇī— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, sammāājīvo ariyo anāsavo lokuttaro maggaṅgo.*

It is refraining, giving up, abstaining from the four wrong way of life that I call the Right way of life- which is noble, free from defilements, takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path- (for someone who aspires) for a noble mind, to be free from defilements, to be endowed with the noble path, for development in the noble path.

> The sequence of words "ārati virati paṭivirati veramaṇī" wherever they appear indicates a process of increased watchfulness towards the actions. The watchfulness begins with internal dialogue and proceeds to whatever actions arise in response to hindrances or negative states of mind. Being watchful of the process leading to the actions being committed will, in the long run, lead to avoiding these unskillful actions. This is a gradual process that is built on top of identifying hindrances in the internal dialogue, overcoming them, and practising restraint of the senses. 

*So micchāājīvassa pahānāya vāyamati, sammāājīvassa upasampadāya; svāssa hoti sammāvāyāmo. So sato micchāājīvaṁ pajahati, sato sammāājīvaṁ upasampajja viharati; sāssa hoti sammāsati. Itiyime tayo dhammā sammāājīvaṁ anuparidhāvanti anuparivattanti, seyyathidaṁ—sammādiṭṭhi, sammāvāyāmo, sammāsati.*

He puts effort into abandoning the Wrong way of life and cultivating the Right way of life, which for him is the right effort. He mindfully abandons the wrong way of life, develops the right way of life, which for him is the Right Awareness. These three things, which revolve around the right way of life, are Right View, Right Effort, and Right Awareness.

*Tatra, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti. Kathañca, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti?*

In this regard, Right View comes first. Why does the right view come first?

*Sammādiṭṭhissa, bhikkhave, sammāsaṅkappo pahoti, sammāsaṅkappassa sammāvācā pahoti, sammāvācassa sammākammanto pahoti, sammākammantassa sammāājīvo pahoti, sammāājīvassa sammāvāyāmo pahoti, sammāvāyāmassa sammāsati pahoti, sammāsatissa sammāsamādhi pahoti, sammāsamādhissa sammāñāṇaṁ pahoti, sammāñāṇassa sammāvimutti pahoti.*

Right view leads to right volition, right volition leads to right speech, right speech leads to right action, right action leads to right way of life, right way of life leads to right effort, right effort leads to right awareness, right awareness leads to right stillness, right stillness leads to right knowledge, right knowledge leads to right freedom. 

*Iti kho, bhikkhave, aṭṭhaṅgasamannāgato sekkho, dasaṅgasamannāgato arahā hoti. *

Monks! In this way, a trainee should have perfected the eight factors (of the noble path), and an awakened person should have perfected the ten factors (of the noble path).

*Tatrapi sammāñāṇena aneke pāpakā akusalā dhammā vigatā bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchanti.*

In this regard, various unwholesome, unskillful states of mind cease and are completely eradicated with right knowledge. 

*Tatra, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti. Kathañca, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti? *

In this regard, Right View comes first. Why does the right view come first?

*Sammādiṭṭhissa, bhikkhave, micchādiṭṭhi nijjiṇṇā hoti. Ye ca micchādiṭṭhipaccayā aneke pāpakā akusalā dhammā sambhavanti te cassa nijjiṇṇā honti. Sammādiṭṭhipaccayā aneke kusalā dhammā bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchanti. *

Right view leads to eradicating the wrong view. Those various unwholesome, unskillful states of mind that arise due to wrong view are also eliminated as a result. Wholesome, skilful states of mind arise due to right view and become fully established. 

*Sammāsaṅkappassa, bhikkhave, micchāsaṅkappo nijjiṇṇo hoti …pe… sammāvācassa, bhikkhave, micchāvācā nijjiṇṇā hoti … sammākammantassa, bhikkhave, micchākammanto nijjiṇṇo hoti … sammāājīvassa, bhikkhave, micchāājīvo nijjiṇṇo hoti … sammāvāyāmassa, bhikkhave, micchāvāyāmo nijjiṇṇo hoti … sammāsatissa, bhikkhave, micchāsati nijjiṇṇā hoti … sammāsamādhissa, bhikkhave, micchāsamādhi nijjiṇṇo hoti … sammāñāṇassa, bhikkhave, micchāñāṇaṁ nijjiṇṇaṁ hoti … *

Right volition leads to the eradication of wrong volition. Those various unwholesome, unskillful states of mind that arise due to wrong volition are also eliminated as a result. Wholesome, skilful states of mind arise due to right volition and become fully established. 
...
Right knowledge leads to the eradication of wrong knowledge. Those various unwholesome, unskillful states of mind that arise due to wrong knowledge are also eliminated as a result. Wholesome, skilful states of mind arise due to right knowledge and become fully established. 

*sammāvimuttassa, bhikkhave, micchāvimutti nijjiṇṇā hoti. Ye ca micchāvimuttipaccayā aneke pāpakā akusalā dhammā sambhavanti te cassa nijjiṇṇā honti. Sammāvimuttipaccayā ca aneke kusalā dhammā bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchanti.*

Right freedom leads to the eradication of wrong freedom. Those various unwholesome, unskillful states of mind that arise due to wrong freedom are also eliminated as a result. Wholesome, skilful states of mind arise due to right freedom and become fully established. 

*Iti kho, bhikkhave, vīsati kusalapakkhā, vīsati akusalapakkhā— mahācattārīsako dhammapariyāyo pavattito appaṭivattiyo samaṇena vā brāhmaṇena vā devena vā mārena vā brahmunā vā kenaci vā lokasmiṁ.*

Monks! In this way, there are 20 on the skilful side and 20 on the unskillful side -- The discourse on The Great Forty has been set in motion. This can not be unset or taken back by any ascetic, brahmin, deity, Death, Brahma or by anyone in this world.  

*Yo hi koci, bhikkhave, samaṇo vā brāhmaṇo vā imaṁ mahācattārīsakaṁ dhammapariyāyaṁ garahitabbaṁ paṭikkositabbaṁ maññeyya tassa diṭṭheva dhamme dasasahadhammikā vādānuvādā gārayhaṁ ṭhānaṁ āgacchanti— *

If any ascetic, brahmin considers criticising, rejecting The Great Forty, then they become blameworthy due to the ten accompanying principles of truth as below - 

*sammādiṭṭhiñce bhavaṁ garahati, ye ca micchādiṭṭhī samaṇabrāhmaṇā te bhoto pujjā, te bhoto pāsaṁsā; *

If they criticise the right view, then they praise and venerate the ascetics or brahmins who have the wrong view.

*Yo koci, bhikkhave, samaṇo vā brāhmaṇo vā imaṁ mahācattārīsakaṁ dhammapariyāyaṁ garahitabbaṁ paṭikkositabbaṁ maññeyya tassa diṭṭheva dhamme ime dasasahadhammikā vādānuvādā gārayhaṁ ṭhānaṁ āgacchanti.*

Thus, if any ascetic, brahmin considers criticising, rejecting The Great Forty, then they become blameworthy due to the ten accompanying principles of truth.

*Yepi te, bhikkhave, ahesuṁ okkalā vassabhaññā ahetuvādā akiriyavādā natthikavādā tepi mahācattārīsakaṁ dhammapariyāyaṁ na garahitabbaṁ nappaṭikkositabbaṁ amaññiṁsu. Taṁ kissa hetu? Nindābyārosaupārambhabhayā”ti.*

Okkala, Vassabhañña of the school of non-causality, who believe there are no consequences to their actions, believe in no ethics, have not considered criticising or insulting The Great Forty. Why is that? Out of fear of blame, rebuke and criticism. 

*Idamavoca bhagavā. Attamanā te bhikkhū bhagavato bhāsitaṁ abhinandunti.*
