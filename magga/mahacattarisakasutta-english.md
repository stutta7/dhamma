# Mahācattārīsakasutta
Majjhima Nikāya (MN 117)

*Evaṁ me sutaṁ— ekaṁ samayaṁ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṁ viharati jetavane anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme. Tatra kho bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi: “bhikkhavo”ti.*

Thus I heard. At a time when the Buddha was residing at Jetavana, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery near Sāvatthī. The Buddha addressed the monks, 

*“Bhadante” ti te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṁ. Bhagavā etadavoca:*

The monks responded with "Yes, Sir". The Buddha spoke thus: 

*“ariyaṁ vo, bhikkhave, sammāsamādhiṁ desessāmi saupanisaṁ saparikkhāraṁ. Taṁ suṇātha, sādhukaṁ manasi karotha, bhāsissāmī”ti.*

Monks, I will teach you the supports and requisites for the noble right samadhi. All of you, pay careful attention, I shall speak. 

*“Evaṁ, bhante”ti kho te bhikkhū bhagavato paccassosuṁ. Bhagavā etadavoca:*

The monks replied, "Yes, Sir". The Buddha spoke thus: 

*“Katamo ca, bhikkhave, ariyo sammāsamādhi saupaniso saparikkhāro? *

What are the supports and the requisites for the noble right samadhi? 

*Seyyathidaṁ—sammādiṭṭhi, sammāsaṅkappo, sammāvācā, sammākammanto, sammāājīvo, sammāvāyāmo, sammāsati; *

They are: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right living, right effort, right mindfulness.

*yā kho, bhikkhave, imehi sattahaṅgehi cittassa ekaggatā parikkhatā— ayaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, ariyo sammāsamādhi saupaniso itipi, saparikkhāro itipi.*

Equipped with these seven factors, the mind becomes collected or unified[^3]; this is what I call supports and the requisites for the noble right samadhi.

*Tatra, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti. Kathañca, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti? *

In this regard, right view is the forerunner. Why is the right view the forerunner? 

*Micchādiṭṭhiṁ ‘micchādiṭṭhī’ti pajānāti, sammādiṭṭhiṁ ‘sammādiṭṭhī’ti pajānāti—sāssa hoti sammādiṭṭhi.*

When one perceives wrong view as 'wrong view' and right view as 'right view', then one has the right view. 

*Katamā ca, bhikkhave, micchādiṭṭhi? *

What is the wrong view? 

*‘Natthi dinnaṁ, natthi yiṭṭhaṁ, natthi hutaṁ, natthi sukatadukkaṭānaṁ kammānaṁ phalaṁ vipāko, natthi ayaṁ loko, natthi paro loko, natthi mātā, natthi pitā, natthi sattā opapātikā, natthi loke samaṇabrāhmaṇā sammaggatā sammāpaṭipannā ye imañca lokaṁ parañca lokaṁ sayaṁ abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedentī’ti— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, micchādiṭṭhi.*

“There is no giving, there is no sacrifice, there is no oblation; there is no fruit or result of good and bad actions; there is no this world, there is no other world; there is no mother, there is no father; there are no beings born spontaneously; there are no ascetics or brahmins rightly practicing who would, having directly known, declare this world and the other.” — This is wrong view.

*Katamā ca, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi? *

What is the right view? 

*Sammādiṭṭhimpahaṁ, bhikkhave, dvāyaṁ vadāmi— atthi, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi sāsavā puññabhāgiyā upadhivepakkā; atthi, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi ariyā anāsavā lokuttarā maggaṅgā.*

The right view can be in two ways. There is the right view that is tainted by defilements, leads to merits[^1] and ripens in clinging/attachment. In contrast, the noble right view, which is noble and free from defilements, takes one beyond the worlds and is a factor of the path.

> **Practice Note:** 
> <sup>The right view is grounded in reason. Through reason, one has concluded that it is the right view. As such, it needs to be supported by willpower to be sustained. On the other hand, the noble right view is attained through direct insight, gained by witnessing the truth within oneself. To reach the insight does require will & effort, but once the insight is reached, the wrong view is shattered in that moment, and the habit pattern changes instantly. </sup>

*Katamā ca, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi sāsavā puññabhāgiyā upadhivepakkā? *

What is the right view that is tainted by defilements, leads to merits[^1] and ripens in clinging/attachment?

*‘Atthi dinnaṁ, atthi yiṭṭhaṁ, atthi hutaṁ, atthi sukatadukkaṭānaṁ kammānaṁ phalaṁ vipāko, atthi ayaṁ loko, atthi paro loko, atthi mātā, atthi pitā, atthi sattā opapātikā, atthi loke samaṇabrāhmaṇā sammaggatā sammāpaṭipannā ye imañca lokaṁ parañca lokaṁ sayaṁ abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedentī’ti— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi sāsavā puññabhāgiyā upadhivepakkā.*

"There is giving, there is sacrifice, there is oblation; there is fruit or result of good and bad actions; there is this world, there is another world; there is mother, there is father; there are beings born spontaneously; there are ascetics or brahmins rightly practising who would, having directly known, declare this world and the other." - This is the right view tainted by defilements, leads to merits[^1] and ripens in clinging/attachment. [^2]

*Katamā ca, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi ariyā anāsavā lokuttarā maggaṅgā? *

What is the noble right view, which is noble and free from defilements, takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path?

*Yā kho, bhikkhave, ariyacittassa anāsavacittassa ariyamaggasamaṅgino ariyamaggaṁ bhāvayato paññā paññindriyaṁ paññābalaṁ dhammavicayasambojjhaṅgo sammādiṭṭhi maggaṅgaṁ— ayaṁ vuccati, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi ariyā anāsavā lokuttarā maggaṅgā.*

It is wisdom - the faculty of wisdom, the power of wisdom, the awakening factor of investigation of the truth- that I call the noble right view- which is noble, free from defilements, takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path- (for someone who aspires) for a noble mind, free from defilements, endowed with the noble path, for development in the noble path.

> **Practice Note:** 
> <sup>All insights gained through direct experience of the truth constitute the noble right view. It does require intention and willpower to reach the state when direct knowledge of the truth is possible. But once direct experience of the truth and insights are gained, the changes are effortless. </sup>

*So micchādiṭṭhiyā pahānāya vāyamati, sammādiṭṭhiyā, upasampadāya, svāssa hoti sammāvāyāmo. *

He puts effort into abandoning the wrong view and cultivating the right view, which for him is the right effort. 

*So sato micchādiṭṭhiṁ pajahati, sato sammādiṭṭhiṁ upasampajja viharati, sāssa hoti sammāsati.*

He mindfully abandons wrong view, develops right view, which for him is the right mindfulness.

*Itiyime tayo dhammā sammādiṭṭhiṁ anuparidhāvanti anuparivattanti, seyyathidaṁ—sammādiṭṭhi, sammāvāyāmo, sammāsati.*

These three things cluster around the right view: they are right view, right effort, and right mindfulness.

> **Practice Note:** 
> <sup>Right view is the forerunner to cultivate right view, right speech, right action, right living. Right view acts like eyes guiding the practitioner to walk the path that leads to right speech, right action, and the right living. </sup>

*Tatra, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti. Kathañca, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti? *

In this regard, right view is the forerunner. Why is the right view the forerunner? 

*Micchāsaṅkappaṁ ‘micchāsaṅkappo’ti pajānāti, sammāsaṅkappaṁ ‘sammāsaṅkappo’ti pajānāti, sāssa hoti sammādiṭṭhi.*

When one recognises wrong thought as 'wrong thought' and right thought as 'right thought', then one possesses the right view. 

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, micchāsaṅkappo? *

What is the wrong thought?

*Kāmasaṅkappo, byāpādasaṅkappo, vihiṁsāsaṅkappo— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, micchāsaṅkappo.*

These are wrong thoughts - thoughts towards sensual desires, ill will and causing harm.

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, sammāsaṅkappo? *

What is the right thought? 

*Sammāsaṅkappampahaṁ, bhikkhave, dvāyaṁ vadāmi— atthi, bhikkhave, sammāsaṅkappo sāsavo puññabhāgiyo upadhivepakko; atthi, bhikkhave, sammāsaṅkappo ariyo anāsavo lokuttaro maggaṅgo.*

The right thought can be in two ways. There is the right thought that is tainted by defilements, leads to merits[^1] and ripens in clinging/attachment. In contrast, the noble right thought is noble and free from defilements, taking you beyond the worlds, and is a factor of the path.

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, sammāsaṅkappo sāsavo puññabhāgiyo upadhivepakko? *

What is the right thought that is tainted by defilements, leads to merits[^1] and ripens in clinging/attachment?

*Nekkhammasaṅkappo, abyāpādasaṅkappo, avihiṁsāsaṅkappo: ‘ayaṁ, bhikkhave, sammāsaṅkappo sāsavo puññabhāgiyo upadhivepakko’.*

The thought of renunciation, generating no ill-will, and causing no harm. This is the right thought that is tainted by defilements, leads to merits[^1] and ripens in clinging/attachment.

> **Practice Note:** 
> <sup>A person who has already walked the path out of goodwill has proclaimed that this is the right thought. If the monk or any reasonable person were to think it through, it becomes clear that thoughts of renunciation, generating no ill-will, and causing no harm are the right thoughts. The wisdom to create no ill-will does not come from within and therefore requires effort and conflict to attain. That is why defilements taint it, lead to merits[^1] and ripen in clinging/attachment. </sup>

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, sammāsaṅkappo ariyo anāsavo lokuttaro maggaṅgo?*

What is the right thought, which is noble and free from defilements, that takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path?

*Yo kho, bhikkhave, ariyacittassa anāsavacittassa ariyamaggasamaṅgino ariyamaggaṁ bhāvayato takko vitakko saṅkappo appanā byappanā cetaso abhiniropanā vacīsaṅkhāro— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, sammāsaṅkappo ariyo anāsavo lokuttaro maggaṅgo.*

> **Practice Note:** 
> <sup>Fixing your mind on recognising when the internal silence ends and the internal dialogue begins. If the beginning is missed, acknowledge that the internal dialogue has begun and identify which hindrance, *nīvarana*, is active at that moment. If ill will has started, recognise that it has begun. If desire has started, recognise that desire has initiated. Refer to [Āhārasutta](/nivarana-bhojjanga/aaharasutta-english.md) to overcome that hindrance. </sup> 
> <sup>The noble right thought focuses its efforts on building the capacity to witness (experience within oneself) what harm thoughts about acquiring wealth, generating ill will, and harming others lead to. Just as a person will not willfully keep their hand on fire, knowing the damage it causes. Similarly, a practitioner will also refrain from thoughts of sensual pleasures, ill will, and harming others without any deliberate effort. In this way, there is no willful effort or conflict; hence, this is a factor of the path.  </sup> 

*So micchāsaṅkappassa pahānāya vāyamati, sammāsaṅkappassa upasampadāya, svāssa hoti sammāvāyāmo. So sato micchāsaṅkappaṁ pajahati, sato sammāsaṅkappaṁ upasampajja viharati; sāssa hoti sammāsati. Itiyime tayo dhammā sammāsaṅkappaṁ anuparidhāvanti anuparivattanti, seyyathidaṁ—sammādiṭṭhi, sammāvāyāmo, sammāsati.

The monk puts effort into abandoning the wrong thought and cultivating the right thought, which for him is the right effort. One mindfully abandons wrong thought, develops right thought, which for him is the right mindfulness. These three things keep circling the right thought: they are right view, right effort, and right mindfulness.

*Tatra, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti. Kathañca, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti?*

In this regard, right view is the forerunner. Why is the right view the forerunner? 

*Micchāvācaṁ ‘micchāvācā’ti pajānāti, sammāvācaṁ ‘sammāvācā’ti pajānāti; sāssa hoti sammādiṭṭhi. Katamā ca, bhikkhave, micchāvācā?*

When one knows wrong speech as 'wrong speech' and right speech as 'right speech', then one has the right view.  What is wrong speech? 

*Musāvādo, pisuṇā vācā, pharusā vācā, samphappalāpo— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, micchāvācā.*

Lies, divisive speech, harsh speech, idle chatter. This is wrong speech.

*Katamā ca, bhikkhave, sammāvācā?*

What is right speech? 

*Sammāvācampahaṁ, bhikkhave, dvāyaṁ vadāmi— atthi, bhikkhave, sammāvācā sāsavā puññabhāgiyā upadhivepakkā; atthi, bhikkhave, sammāvācā ariyā anāsavā lokuttarā maggaṅgā.*

Right speech is of two ways. There is a right speech that is tainted by defilements, leads to merits[^1] and ripens in clinging/attachment. In contrast, the noble right speech, which is noble and free from defilements, takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path.

*Katamā ca, bhikkhave, sammāvācā sāsavā puññabhāgiyā upadhivepakkā?*

What is the right speech that is tainted by defilements, leads to merits[^1] and ripens in clinging/attachment?

*Musāvādā veramaṇī, pisuṇāya vācāya veramaṇī, pharusāya vācāya veramaṇī, samphappalāpā veramaṇī— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, sammāvācā sāsavā puññabhāgiyā upadhivepakkā.*

Refraining from false speech, divisive speech, harsh speech, and idle chatter. This is the right speech that is tainted by defilements, leads to merits[^1] and ripens in clinging/attachment.

*Katamā ca, bhikkhave, sammāvācā ariyā anāsavā lokuttarā maggaṅgā? *

What is the noble right speech, which is noble and free from defilements, that takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path?

*Yā kho, bhikkhave, ariyacittassa anāsavacittassa ariyamaggasamaṅgino ariyamaggaṁ bhāvayato catūhi vacīduccaritehi ārati virati paṭivirati veramaṇī— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, sammāvācā ariyā anāsavā lokuttarā maggaṅgā.*

It is refraining, giving up, abstaining from the four wrong speech that I call the noble right speech, which is noble, free from defilements, takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path- (for someone who aspires) for a noble mind, free from defilements, endowed with the noble path, for development in the noble path.

> **Practice Note**:
> <sup>Veramani is abandoning wrong speech through a process of gradually increasing mindfulness about the state of mind that leads one to commit wrong speech. This mindfulness helps in recognising when verbal misconduct is about to happen and ultimately avoiding wrong speech altogether. This process occurs naturally as mindfulness increases and is not an act of will. </sup>
> <sup>When the monk or trainee speaks a lie, they are immediately aware that what they have said is a lie. The next step is to recognise that a lie is about to be spoken by continuously being aware of the internal state of mind, and ultimately, completely abandoning speaking lies. As this is not an act of will, it ripens naturally with awareness; therefore, it does not give rise to defilements. This is why it is considered a factor in the path. </sup>

*So micchāvācāya pahānāya vāyamati, sammāvācāya upasampadāya; svāssa hoti sammāvāyāmo.*

The monk puts effort into abandoning the wrong speech and cultivating the right speech, which is the right effort.

*So sato micchāvācaṁ pajahati, sato sammāvācaṁ upasampajja viharati; sāssa hoti sammāsati.*

The monk mindfully abandons wrong speech, develops right speech, which for him is the right mindfulness.

*Itiyime tayo dhammā sammāvācaṁ anuparidhāvanti anuparivattanti, seyyathidaṁ—sammādiṭṭhi, sammāvāyāmo, sammāsati.*

These three things keep going around the right speech: they are right view, right Effort, and right mindfulness.

*Tatra, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti. Kathañca, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti? *

In this regard, right view is the forerunner. Why is the right view the forerunner? 

*Micchākammantaṁ ‘micchākammanto’ti pajānāti, sammākammantaṁ ‘sammākammanto’ti pajānāti; sāssa hoti sammādiṭṭhi.*

When one knows wrong action as 'wrong action' and right action as 'right action', then one has the right action.

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, micchākammanto?*

What is the wrong action? 

*Pāṇātipāto, adinnādānaṁ, kāmesumicchācāro— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, micchākammanto.*

Taking life, taking what is not given, misconduct concerning sensual desires. This is the wrong action.

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, sammākammanto?*

What is right action? 

*Sammākammantampahaṁ, bhikkhave, dvāyaṁ vadāmi— atthi, bhikkhave, sammākammanto sāsavo puññabhāgiyo upadhivepakko; atthi, bhikkhave, sammākammanto ariyo anāsavo lokuttaro maggaṅgo.*

The right action is in two ways. There is a right action that is tainted by defilements, leads to merits[^1] and ripens in clinging/attachment. In contrast, the noble right action, which is noble and free from defilements, takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path.

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, sammākammanto sāsavo puññabhāgiyo upadhivepakko?*

What is the right action that is tainted by defilements, leads to merits[^1] and ripens in clinging/attachment?

*Pāṇātipātā veramaṇī, adinnādānā veramaṇī, kāmesumicchācārā veramaṇī— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, sammākammanto sāsavo puññabhāgiyo upadhivepakko.*

Abandoning taking life, abandoning taking what is not given, abandoning misconduct concerning sensual desires. This is the right action that is tainted by defilements, leads to merits[^1] and ripens in clinging/attachment.

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, sammākammanto ariyo anāsavo lokuttaro maggaṅgo?*

What is the noble right action, which is noble and free from defilements, that takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path?

*Yā kho, bhikkhave, ariyacittassa anāsavacittassa ariyamaggasamaṅgino ariyamaggaṁ bhāvayato tīhi kāyaduccaritehi ārati virati paṭivirati veramaṇī— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, sammākammanto ariyo anāsavo lokuttaro maggaṅgo.*

It is refraining, giving up, abstaining from the three wrong actions that I call the noble right action, which is noble, free from defilements, takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path- (for someone who aspires) for a noble mind, free from defilements, endowed with the noble path, for development in the noble path.

> **Practice Note**:
> <sup>The Pali word veramaṇī is complete abandonment of wrong actions, similar to right speech, through a process of increased self-awareness of the states of mind leading to wrong action. Harming someone physically can only occur after one has generated anger towards that person in their thoughts. </sup>
> <sup>This process of increased self-awareness is built on top of mindfulness of the internal dialogue and understanding of how the mind is affected by the sense doors. The combination of the two gives the monk or trainee the necessary foundation to recognise an inclination to commit misconduct before it is committed and thereby avert the action. </sup>
> <sup>At this stage, it is a good practice to approach a teacher or a person respected by the monk or trainee and confess to making a mistake, promising restraint in this regard in the future. </sup>


*So micchākammantassa pahānāya vāyamati, sammākammantassa upasampadāya; svāssa hoti sammāvāyāmo.So sato micchākammantaṁ pajahati, sato sammākammantaṁ upasampajja viharati; sāssa hoti sammāsati. Itiyime tayo dhammā sammākammantaṁ anuparidhāvanti anuparivattanti, seyyathidaṁ—sammādiṭṭhi, sammāvāyāmo, sammāsati.*

One puts effort into abandoning the wrong action and cultivating the right action, which for him is the right effort. One mindfully abandons wrong action and develops right action, which for him is the right mindfulness. These three things, which revolve around right action, are right view, right Effort, and right mindfulness.

*Tatra, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti. Kathañca, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti? *

In this regard, right view is the forerunner. Why is the right view the forerunner? 

*Micchāājīvaṁ ‘micchāājīvo’ti pajānāti, sammāājīvaṁ ‘sammāājīvo’ti pajānāti; sāssa hoti sammādiṭṭhi.*

When one knows the wrong living as 'wrong living' and the right living as 'right living', then one has the right view.

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, micchāājīvo? *

What is the wrong living? 

*Kuhanā, lapanā, nemittikatā, nippesikatā, lābhena lābhaṁ nijigīsanatā— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, micchāājīvo.*

Deception, flattery, soliciting gain by cheating, belittling, covetousness for profit. This is the wrong living. 

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, sammāājīvo? *

What is the right living? 

*Sammāājīvampahaṁ, bhikkhave, dvāyaṁ vadāmi— atthi, bhikkhave, sammāājīvo sāsavo puññabhāgiyo upadhivepakko; atthi, bhikkhave, sammāājīvo ariyo anāsavo lokuttaro maggaṅgo.*

The right living is of two ways. There is a right living that is tainted by defilements, leads to merits[^1] and ripens in clinging/attachment. In contrast, there is the noble right living, which is noble and free from defilements, taking you beyond the worlds and a factor of the path.

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, sammāājīvo sāsavo puññabhāgiyo upadhivepakko? *

What is the right living that is tainted by defilements, leads to merits[^1] and ripens in clinging/attachment?

*Idha, bhikkhave, ariyasāvako micchāājīvaṁ pahāya sammāājīvena jīvikaṁ kappeti— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, sammāājīvo sāsavo puññabhāgiyo upadhivepakko.*

Monks, A noble disciple who abandons the wrong living and leads a life towards the right living is said to have the right living that is tainted by defilements, leads to merits[^1] and ripens in clinging/attachment.

*Katamo ca, bhikkhave, sammāājīvo ariyo anāsavo lokuttaro maggaṅgo? *

What is the right living, which is noble and free from defilements, that takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path?

*Yā kho, bhikkhave, ariyacittassa anāsavacittassa ariyamaggasamaṅgino ariyamaggaṁ bhāvayato micchāājīvā ārati virati paṭivirati veramaṇī— ayaṁ, bhikkhave, sammāājīvo ariyo anāsavo lokuttaro maggaṅgo.*

It is refraining, giving up, abstaining from wrong living that I call the right living- which is noble, free from defilements, takes you beyond the worlds, a factor of the path- (for someone who aspires) for a noble mind, to be free from defilements, to be endowed with the noble path, for development in the noble path.

> **Practice Note:** 
> <sup>The sequence of words "ārati virati paṭivirati veramaṇī" wherever they appear indicates a process of increased watchfulness over one's actions. The watchfulness begins with internal dialogue and proceeds to whatever actions arise in response to hindrances or negative states of mind. Being watchful of the process leading to the actions being committed will, in the long run, lead to avoiding these unskillful actions. This is a gradual process that is built on top of identifying hindrances in the internal dialogue, overcoming them, and practising restraint of the senses. </sup>

*So micchāājīvassa pahānāya vāyamati, sammāājīvassa upasampadāya; svāssa hoti sammāvāyāmo. So sato micchāājīvaṁ pajahati, sato sammāājīvaṁ upasampajja viharati; sāssa hoti sammāsati. Itiyime tayo dhammā sammāājīvaṁ anuparidhāvanti anuparivattanti, seyyathidaṁ—sammādiṭṭhi, sammāvāyāmo, sammāsati.*

One puts effort into abandoning the wrong living and cultivating the right living, which for him is the right effort. One mindfully abandons the wrong living and develops the right living, which for him is the right mindfulness. These three things, which revolve around the right living, are right view, right Effort, and right mindfulness.

*Tatra, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti. Kathañca, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti?*

In this regard, right view is the forerunner. Why is the right view the forerunner? 

*Sammādiṭṭhissa, bhikkhave, sammāsaṅkappo pahoti, sammāsaṅkappassa sammāvācā pahoti, sammāvācassa sammākammanto pahoti, sammākammantassa sammāājīvo pahoti, sammāājīvassa sammāvāyāmo pahoti, sammāvāyāmassa sammāsati pahoti, sammāsatissa sammāsamādhi pahoti, sammāsamādhissa sammāñāṇaṁ pahoti, sammāñāṇassa sammāvimutti pahoti.*

Right view leads to right thought, right thought leads to right speech, right speech leads to right action, right action leads to right living, right living leads to right effort, right effort leads to right mindfulness, right mindfulness leads to right samadhi, right samadhi leads to right knowledge, right knowledge leads to right freedom. 

*Iti kho, bhikkhave, aṭṭhaṅgasamannāgato sekkho, dasaṅgasamannāgato arahā hoti. *

Monks! In this way, a trainee should have perfected the eight factors (of the noble path), and an awakened person should have perfected the ten factors (of the noble path).

*Tatrapi sammāñāṇena aneke pāpakā akusalā dhammā vigatā bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchanti.*

In this regard, various unwholesome, unskillful states of mind cease and are completely eradicated with right knowledge. 

*Tatra, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti. Kathañca, bhikkhave, sammādiṭṭhi pubbaṅgamā hoti? *

In this regard, right view is the forerunner. Why is the right view the forerunner? 

*Sammādiṭṭhissa, bhikkhave, micchādiṭṭhi nijjiṇṇā hoti. Ye ca micchādiṭṭhipaccayā aneke pāpakā akusalā dhammā sambhavanti te cassa nijjiṇṇā honti. Sammādiṭṭhipaccayā aneke kusalā dhammā bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchanti. *

The right view leads to the withering away of the wrong view. Those various unwholesome, unskillful states of mind that arise due to wrong view are also eliminated as a result. Wholesome, skilful states of mind arise due to right view and become fully established. 

*Sammāsaṅkappassa, bhikkhave, micchāsaṅkappo nijjiṇṇo hoti …pe… sammāvācassa, bhikkhave, micchāvācā nijjiṇṇā hoti … sammākammantassa, bhikkhave, micchākammanto nijjiṇṇo hoti … sammāājīvassa, bhikkhave, micchāājīvo nijjiṇṇo hoti … sammāvāyāmassa, bhikkhave, micchāvāyāmo nijjiṇṇo hoti … sammāsatissa, bhikkhave, micchāsati nijjiṇṇā hoti … sammāsamādhissa, bhikkhave, micchāsamādhi nijjiṇṇo hoti … sammāñāṇassa, bhikkhave, micchāñāṇaṁ nijjiṇṇaṁ hoti … *

Right thought leads to the withering away of wrong thought. Those various unwholesome, unskillful states of mind that arise due to wrong thought are also eliminated as a result. Wholesome, skilful states of mind arise due to right thought and become fully established. 
...
Right knowledge leads to the withering away of wrong knowledge. Those various unwholesome, unskillful states of mind that arise due to wrong knowledge are also eliminated as a result. Wholesome, skilful states of mind arise due to right knowledge and become fully established. 

*sammāvimuttassa, bhikkhave, micchāvimutti nijjiṇṇā hoti. Ye ca micchāvimuttipaccayā aneke pāpakā akusalā dhammā sambhavanti te cassa nijjiṇṇā honti. Sammāvimuttipaccayā ca aneke kusalā dhammā bhāvanāpāripūriṁ gacchanti.*

Right freedom leads to the withering away of wrong freedom. Those various unwholesome, unskillful states of mind that arise due to wrong freedom are also eliminated as a result. Wholesome, skilful states of mind arise due to right freedom and become fully established. 

*Iti kho, bhikkhave, vīsati kusalapakkhā, vīsati akusalapakkhā— mahācattārīsako dhammapariyāyo pavattito appaṭivattiyo samaṇena vā brāhmaṇena vā devena vā mārena vā brahmunā vā kenaci vā lokasmiṁ.*

Monks! So there are twenty on the side of the skilful, and twenty on the side of the unskillful. This exposition of the teaching on the Great Forty has been rolled forth. And it cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or divinity or by anyone in the world. [^2] 

*Yo hi koci, bhikkhave, samaṇo vā brāhmaṇo vā imaṁ mahācattārīsakaṁ dhammapariyāyaṁ garahitabbaṁ paṭikkositabbaṁ maññeyya tassa diṭṭheva dhamme dasasahadhammikā vādānuvādā gārayhaṁ ṭhānaṁ āgacchanti— *

If any ascetic, brahmin considers criticising, rejecting The Great Forty, then they become blameworthy due to the ten accompanying principles of truth as below - 

*sammādiṭṭhiñce bhavaṁ garahati, ye ca micchādiṭṭhī samaṇabrāhmaṇā te bhoto pujjā, te bhoto pāsaṁsā; *

If they criticise the right view, then they praise and venerate the ascetics or brahmins who have the wrong view. 

*sammāsaṅkappañce bhavaṁ garahati, ye ca micchāsaṅkappā samaṇabrāhmaṇā te bhoto pujjā, te bhoto pāsaṁsā; sammāvācañce bhavaṁ garahati …pe… sammākammantañce bhavaṁ garahati … sammāājīvañce bhavaṁ garahati … sammāvāyāmañce bhavaṁ garahati … sammāsatiñce bhavaṁ garahati … sammāsamādhiñce bhavaṁ garahati … sammāñāṇañce bhavaṁ garahati … sammāvimuttiñce bhavaṁ garahati, ye ca micchāvimuttī samaṇabrāhmaṇā te bhoto pujjā, te bhoto pāsaṁsā.*

If they criticise the right thought, then they praise and venerate the ascetics or brahmins who have the wrong thought.
If they criticise the right speech, then they praise and venerate the ascetics or brahmins who have the wrong speech.
If they criticise the right action, then they praise and venerate the ascetics or brahmins who have the wrong action.
If they criticise the right living, then they praise and venerate the ascetics or brahmins who have the wrong living.
If they criticise the right effort, then they praise and venerate the ascetics or brahmins who have the wrong effort.
If they criticise the right mindfulness, then they praise and venerate the ascetics or brahmins who have the wrong mindfulness.
If they criticise the right samadhi, then they praise and venerate the ascetics or brahmins who have the wrong samadhi.
If they criticise the right knowledge, then they praise and venerate the ascetics or brahmins who have the wrong knowledge.
If they criticise the right freedom, then they praise and venerate the ascetics or brahmins who have the wrong freedom.
If they criticise the right freedom, then they praise and venerate the ascetics or brahmins who have the wrong freedom.

*Yo koci, bhikkhave, samaṇo vā brāhmaṇo vā imaṁ mahācattārīsakaṁ dhammapariyāyaṁ garahitabbaṁ paṭikkositabbaṁ maññeyya tassa diṭṭheva dhamme ime dasasahadhammikā vādānuvādā gārayhaṁ ṭhānaṁ āgacchanti.*

Thus, if any ascetic, brahmin considers criticising, rejecting The Great Forty, then they become blameworthy due to the ten accompanying principles of truth.

*Yepi te, bhikkhave, ahesuṁ okkalā vassabhaññā ahetuvādā akiriyavādā natthikavādā tepi mahācattārīsakaṁ dhammapariyāyaṁ na garahitabbaṁ nappaṭikkositabbaṁ amaññiṁsu. Taṁ kissa hetu? Nindābyārosaupārambhabhayā”ti.*

Even those wanderers of the past, Vassa and Bhañña of Ukkalā, who adhered to the doctrines of no-cause, inaction, and nihilism, didn’t imagine that the Great Forty should be criticised or rejected.[^2]

*Idamavoca bhagavā. Attamanā te bhikkhū bhagavato bhāsitaṁ abhinandunti.*

The Buddha thus spoke. The monks approved what the Buddha said. 

[^1]: puññabhāgiyā could also mean, which leads to diminishing of the merits, if bhāgiyā is considered something that divides.

[^3]: Here, ekaggatā is translated as _unification of mind_ rather than ‘one-pointedness.’ One-pointedness suggests exclusion and suppression, while unification of mind better captures the inclusive, harmonising quality of samādhi as taught in the discourses.
